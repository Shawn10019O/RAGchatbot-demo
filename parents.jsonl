What kinds of exercises should I do?” Or, “What\nexercises should I give my patients with hemophilia?” The answer is simple too: “It depends.” \nThere is no such thing as “exercises for hemophilia.” Different exercises serve different purposes and\n“each person’s situation” is unique. Exercise, like medicine, works best when there has been a complete\nassessment done by a trained professional, and specific exercises have been chosen that suit the\n“individual’s goals and ability.” \nThis guide is intended for: \n• physical therapists with little experience working with people with bleeding disorders; \n• other healthcare workers, such as community rehabilitation workers and physical therapy\nassistants working in areas where a physical therapist is not always available; and\n• people with hemophilia and their families.  \nSection 1 – How Joints and Muscles are Affected by Hemophilia provides a description of common muscle\nand joint bleeds and how particular muscles and joints react to bleeds over the long term. Physical\ntherapists who have little experience with treating people with hemophilia should read this section first.\nSection 2 – A Few Words About Exercise and Hemophilia provides some important “dos and don’ts” for\nphysical therapists and people with hemophilia.\nThe subsequent sections provide a description of exercises that aim to counteract the long-term effects\nof joint and muscle bleeding and the tendency to develop abnormal postures. These are by no means the\nonly exercises that can be used, but they have been selected for specific goals and because they are\nrelatively safe to do with minimal equipment and little supervision. The exercises can be photocopied\nand distributed to patients by physical therapists. At the beginning of each section is a description of the\nanatomy and the frequent problems related to that part of the body.  \nSection 3 – Suggested Joint Exercises provides exercise progressions for the knee, ankle, and elbow joints,\nfocusing on range of motion, strength, and proprioception. \nSection 4 – Suggested Muscles Exercises provides exercise progressions to strengthen or lengthen muscles\nthat have become tight due to bleeding or in response to joint bleeds. Exercises for each muscle have been\nchosen that will restore length (flexibility) and muscle strength. The exercises focus on the following\nmuscles: iliopsoas (hip flexor), gastrocnemius (calf), hamstrings, forearm flexors, and quadriceps.\nA Glossary of Terms can be found at the back, with definitions for the words that appear in bold text\nthroughout the guide.\nThe exercises in this guide are not the only exercises useful for people with hemophilia. They have been\nchosen to meet specific goals, and because they are relatively safe to do with minimal equipment and\nsupervision. The “right” exercise for each individual depends on many things: \n• What is the goal of the exercise program? Different exercises are selected depending on whether\nthere is a need to improve mobility, strength and/or coordination, cardiovascular fitness, or\nability in simple activities or sports.  \n• Has there been a recent bleed?\n• Is there a target joint?\n• Is there a deformity or some joint damage that has been present for a long time?", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/common/•WFH_EPH.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604165120", "file_path": "knowledge_base/common/•WFH_EPH.pdf", "total_pages": 50, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604165120", "page": 4}}

Some people with hemophilia may be tempted to try these\nprograms since they are told that exercise is good for people with hemophilia. In other situations, exercises\nare “prescribed” by practitioners who have no training in exercise selection. Both of these approaches can\nbe frustrating and unsuccessful at best, and in the worst-case scenarios can cause further damage. \nOne exercise program does not meet the needs of all people with hemophilia. The wrong exercise, an\nexercise done incorrectly, an exercise done at the wrong time in the recovery stage, or an exercise done at\nthe wrong frequency or intensity can cause harm. \nSome people with hemophilia avoid exercise because they think it may cause bleeds, but regular physical\nactivity can actually help prevent bleeds and joint damage. Exercise is important for building healthy\nbones and strengthening the muscles that support joints. \nIdeally, exercises should be prescribed for people with hemophilia by a skilled and patient physical\ntherapist following a detailed assessment. The exercise program should then be supervised and advanced\ncarefully by the same physical therapist. However, this is not always possible for many reasons: \n• Not all physical therapists are familiar with hemophilia and its effects on joints and muscles;\n• Comprehensive hemophilia treatment centres (HTCs) do not exist in all countries;\n• Even when HTCs do exist, individuals with hemophilia may see the HTC physical therapist only\ninfrequently (for example, at the annual assessment). Interim communication is done by phone,\nfax, or wireless communication devices. Assessment and the assignment of exercises are done\nremotely instead of face to face;  \n• Individuals with hemophilia and/or nurses and physicians may not be aware of all that\nphysical therapy can offer, and the physical therapist is not consulted for an opinion;\n• In smaller or more remote communities, there may be no physical therapist available.  \nThis guide should be used:\n• at annual assessment clinic visits with the HTC physical therapist (exercises should be reviewed\nto ensure that they are still appropriate for the individual);\n• for rehabilitation during recovery from bleeds, especially if the patient lives far away from the\nHTC (the physical therapist can prescribe exercises by phone or e-mail based on patient\ndescriptions of their status); and\n• in the home, as a reference to ensure that the exercises are being done correctly. \nExercise is a good thing. Too much rest is not good for anyone, and the right amount of activity, whether\nphysical or mental, is very beneficial. Adults must “use it or lose it” and children must “learn how to use it.”", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/common/•WFH_EPH.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604165120", "file_path": "knowledge_base/common/•WFH_EPH.pdf", "total_pages": 50, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604165120", "page": 5}}

Joints such as the hip and the shoulder, however, have multiple degrees of freedom of\nmovement and can move around in many directions without strain. These ball and socket joints are not\naffected by bleeds as often as the hinge joints.\nSecond, the hinge joints are not surrounded by protective muscles, whereas the hip and shoulder joints\nare covered by many layers of strong muscles. The muscles of the knees, ankles, and elbows are situated\nabove and below the joints and in most cases only the tendons cross over the actual joints. Therefore, the\njoints are not as well protected on all sides.\nFigure 1: Joints Affected by Hemophilic Bleeding", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/common/•WFH_EPH.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604165120", "file_path": "knowledge_base/common/•WFH_EPH.pdf", "total_pages": 50, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604165120", "page": 6}}

Muscles function as either\n“stabilizers” or “mobilizers.”  Stabilizer muscles provide stability to the body and limbs. They work\nconstantly to hold the body up against gravity, or allow the body to remain still while we superimpose a\nmovement. They are made up mainly of muscle fibre types that do not fatigue quickly. Mobilizer muscles\nproduce movement and work only when they are needed to perform a particular task. These muscles\nwork in short bursts and are made up mainly of muscle fibre types that fatigue quickly. \nStabilizer muscles are usually deep muscles, located near the joints. When there is an injury in the area, they\nreact by becoming weaker. The nearby mobilizer muscles are then called on to take over the stabilizing\nfunction. Because they fatigue quickly, mobilizer muscles cannot perform as the stabilizer muscles do. The\nmobilizer muscles then become tight and painful and are easily injured if they are stretched or overworked. \nMuscles that react by tightening include the flexor muscles of the wrist and fingers, calf muscles,\nhamstrings, and hip flexor muscles (iliopsoas). Figure 2 shows that these are also the common sites of\nmuscle bleeding in people with hemophilia.\nMuscles that react by weakening include the quadriceps, triceps, and hip extensor muscles. Over time, the\nweak muscles become weaker and the tight muscles become tighter. \nThis is why a proper assessment of muscle function is so very important before an exercise program is\nselected. The right muscles must be trained in the right way or the situation can be made worse. \nFigure 2: Muscles Affected by Hemophilic Bleeding", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/common/•WFH_EPH.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604165120", "file_path": "knowledge_base/common/•WFH_EPH.pdf", "total_pages": 50, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604165120", "page": 7}}

No problem.\nMany people are afraid to try exercises or to prescribe all but the most basic exercises if factor (clotting\nfactor concentrate, cryoprecipitate, plasma) is not readily available. They are concerned that exercise may\ncause bleeding. The exercises in this guide are arranged in levels of difficulty from least difficult to more\nstrenous. The most strenuous exercises are identified clearly, and instructions are provided on how to work\nup to these more difficult levels safely. If the principles and warnings given in the guide are observed, lack\nof treatment products should not deter people from beginning an exercise program. By the same token,\naccess to treatment products does not mean that people should begin at a level that is too difficult.\nSlow and steady.\nAs they learn new exercises, adolescents often want to show off how much they can do and may over exert\nthemselves without realizing it. It is very important to begin slowly and progress gradually. \nDon’t underestimate isometric exercises.\nIsometric exercises involve contracting a muscle without producing movement at the joint. Isometrics are\nan excellent way to begin exercising if muscles are very weak, or if joints are very painful with movement. \nNo gain with pain.\nPain is usually a sign that something is wrong. People with hemophilia must learn to listen to their\nbodies, and physical therapists must listen to what they say. If a new pain begins during exercising, it is\nvery important that it be analysed carefully: Is this muscle fatigue, or the sign of a new bleed? Is the\nexercise placing too much strain on a damaged joint? \nIt is not uncommon for physical therapists to exhort patients to do “just a few more” exercises. Many\npeople with hemophilia tell stories of times when “the physical therapist made me have a bleed.” If the\nperson with hemophilia says he has done enough exercises or repetitions, it is wise to believe him. \nEach situation is unique.\nThe number of exercises and repetitions depends on the situation of each individual. If it is very soon\nafter a bleed, two or three repetitions may be all that can be tolerated. If the bleed has stopped and the\naim is to restore lost range of motion, more repetitions may be needed. The individual and the therapist\nmust listen to the signals from the body — discomfort usually means enough for that session.\nThe number of repetitions will also depend on which type of muscle is being exercised. The stabilizer\nmuscles need to be able to work repeatedly and for long periods; they should be trained with low\nresistance but many repetitions.\nUse gravity and body weight as resistance to start.\nSometimes, the simplest exercises are quite adequate. Membership at the gym or investment in exercise\nequipment is not necessary. In fact, using exercise apparatus may be difficult for someone with arthropathy\nor someone who is recovering from a bleed. Start with simple, practical, functional exercises, and allow\nthe individual to progress.  \nThink about the other joints. \nSome of the exercises designed to help one joint may place too much stress on other joints. For example,\nweight-bearing exercises to strengthen a knee may be difficult and ill advised if the ankle on the same leg\nis damaged.", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/common/•WFH_EPH.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604165120", "file_path": "knowledge_base/common/•WFH_EPH.pdf", "total_pages": 50, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604165120", "page": 10}}

The exercises for someone having\ntrouble getting on and off a chair will be different than for someone having trouble running.\nFurthermore, compliance with any exercise program will be increased by choosing exercises that relate\nto the individual’s functional goals.\nDon’t forget proprioception. \nProprioception is the process by which the body reacts to changes in joint position. The joint position\nreceptors are located in the joint capsule and can be damaged when the capsule is stretched during bleeds.\nFailure to restore proprioception will result in the inability of the joint to respond quickly enough to new\nstresses, and the potential for easy re-injury. \nNormal range of motion and muscle length.\nThe goal with most exercises in this guide is to “continue until range/strength is equal to the opposite\nside.” This only applies if the opposite side has full and “normal” range and strength, and the affected\njoint or muscle had full and “normal” range and/or strength to begin with.\nSome people have developed chronic limitation of certain movements and “normal” range of motion is no\nlonger possible. In these cases, the objective of the exercises is to prevent additional loss of function and\nto return the joint or muscle back to its usual state as soon as possible after new bleeds.\nEveryday activities are important too.\nExercise is important to counteract the long-term effects of bleeding in the key joints and muscle groups.\nMany people find it difficult to stick to a regimented exercise program: it is important to remember that\nmany everyday activities, such as walking, riding a bicycle, climbing stairs, or even shoveling snow can\nhave beneficial effects too. However, specific exercises may be needed to work on certain trouble spots.\nThe exercises in this guide are by no means the only exercises useful for people with hemophilia, but they\nhave been chosen to meet specific goals.\n“Exercise and joint rehabilitation don’t come easily to me. However, when I discipline myself to follow my physical\ntherapy protocol, I find myself with less pain, more motion and fewer bleeds. With exercise and hemophilia,\nslow and steady really does win the race. Pushing oneself too hard leads to setbacks, but stretching yourself just\nenough builds strength without causing bleeds.”\n– 26-year-old with severe hemophilia A, United States\n“There are excellent static exercises that don’t involve using weights. Yoga positions like the Bridge,\nthe Plough, the Grasshopper, Heel-Toe, etc. are fantastic for stretching and toning. I do them every day\nand I can’t recommend them highly enough.”\n– 49-year-old with severe hemophilia A, South Africa\n“The non-compliance was sky high.

Being both a hinge joint and a\nweight-bearing joint, the patellofemoral joint is subject to many stresses during the course of a day. Knee\nextension is easily lost due to reflex inhibition of the quadriceps muscle and overuse or spasm of the\nhamstrings.

Muscle\nbleeds are sometimes not recognized as bleeds and can be mistaken for a strained muscle. With deep\nmuscle bleeds, there are often no visible signs. \nSome muscles cross two joints; one joint may move perfectly but movement at the other joint may be\naffected. It is often only by testing the movements at both joints simultaneously that the problem becomes\napparent. A sound knowledge of anatomy is essential to assess and rehabilitate the two-joint muscles. \nIt is also imperative to compare the combined muscle length of the affected limb to that of the opposite\nlimb. Rehabilitation is not complete until there is enough muscle length to allow all the segments to move\nfully at the same time — a common error is to restore length to only one section of the muscle. For example,\nafter a calf bleed, it may be possible to fully dorsiflex the ankle with the knee flexed, but not with the knee\nextended.\nMuscle bleeds are also a challenge because they can create tremendous complications. Deep muscle\ncompartment bleeds can cause temporary or permanent nerve impairment, and if the pressure is severe,\narterial compression and muscle necrosis can result. \nSome muscles, because of their location and function, are difficult to rest adequately. Many of the muscles\nmost commonly affected by hemophilic bleeds react to injury by weakening. Most muscles lose some\nflexibility as they heal. Recurrence of bleeding after a few days of improvement is not unusual.   \nIdeally, progress and resolution of hematomas are tracked with diagnostic ultrasound. When this is not\npossible, careful attention to the clinical assessment is crucial. The patient can usually tell whether the\nmuscle is feeling looser and less painful as the exercises progress or if the muscle is becoming more\npainful. The physical therapist must listen carefully to the patients.\nSupporting the limb with a splint between exercise sessions, in a position of comfort while maintaining\nsome length, may be very helpful to regain muscle length. The splint can be adjusted as muscle length\nimproves. \nRehabilitation of muscles must also include strengthening exercises to restore power and build endurance. \nThe following exercises will help stretch or lengthen muscles that have become tight due to bleeding or in\nresponse to joint bleeds.  These stretches must be done as active, not passive, stretches, without external\nassistance from therapists or caregivers. They must be done with great care in order to avoid further injury\nto the muscle and new bleeds.\nStretches must be done slowly and gradually. The limb should be stretched only until the point where the\nmuscle begins to feel tight, no further. The stretch should be held for several seconds, then relaxed. It may\nbe possible to gently stretch a tiny bit further with each subsequent stretch, but the individual must be\ntaught not to stretch too far. \nExercises for each muscle have been chosen that will restore length (flexibility) and muscle strength. The\nexercises focus on the following muscles: iliopsoas (hip flexor), gastrocnemius (calf), hamstrings, forearm\nflexors, and quadriceps.", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/common/•WFH_EPH.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604165120", "file_path": "knowledge_base/common/•WFH_EPH.pdf", "total_pages": 50, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604165120", "page": 26}}

The\npsoas portion of the muscle attaches to the spine as well as the\nfemur; tightness of this muscle or injury to it causes the hip to\nflex and the back to arch. \nThe femoral nerve and femoral artery lie adjacent to the psoas\nmuscle, therefore bleeding at this site can have serious con-\nsequences.  Pressure on the nerve can lead first to numbness\nand loss of sensation along the front of the thigh. This is an\nimportant early warning sign. If pressure continues to increase\non the femoral nerve, the quadriceps muscle will weaken and\nthere will be difficulty straightening the knee. This can be a\nserious and permanent result of a psoas bleed. \nKey points about the psoas: \n• A psoas muscle bleed can take many weeks and even months to resolve completely. Therefore,\nrehabilitation needs to be slow and carefully supervised.  \n• Psoas bleeds must be rested completely until the bleeding has stopped. This means no walking\nis allowed at first, not even with crutches.  \n• Numbness or tingling at the front of the thigh is an early indication of nerve damage. If this\nhappens, consult a treatment centre or hemophilia specialist immediately for an assessment. \n• Rehabilitation, towards regaining full flexibility and restoring strength, must be carried out\nunder the close supervision of a physical therapist. \n• The psoas muscle can re-bleed easily even after it seems to be recovering. Be patient and be\nprepared for the patient to resume bedrest if there are any signs of a new bleed, such as increasing\npain or difficulty moving.", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/common/•WFH_EPH.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604165120", "file_path": "knowledge_base/common/•WFH_EPH.pdf", "total_pages": 50, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604165120", "page": 27}}

Since the publication \nof the second edition in 2012, tremendous advances \nhave been made in several aspects of the management \nof hemophilia. These include genetic assessment as well \nas therapy with many innovative therapeutic products \nincluding extended half-life factor VIII (FVIII) and factor \nIX (FIX) products, a bi-specific antibody, and hemostasis \nrebalancing drugs now in clinical development. All of \nthese allow for more effective hemostasis than was possible \nin the past. Laboratory monitoring of therapies is better \ndefined and prophylaxis is accepted as the only way to \nchange the natural history of bleeding. There are highly \neffective therapies for patients with inhibitors. Outcome \nassessment with validated clinimetric instruments is widely \nadvocated and practiced. All these advances are reflected in \nthis third edition of the WFH guidelines, with new chapters \ndevoted to several of these topics along with a new chapter \non principles of care that aims to provide a framework for \ndevelopment of a comprehensive healthcare system for \nhemophilia including advocacy and empowerment for \npeople with hemophilia (PWH). The recommendations in \nthis edition were all developed through a formal evidence-\ninformed and consensus-based methodology involving \nmultidisciplinary healthcare professionals (HCPs) and \nwell-informed PWH. While directed primarily at HCPs, \nthese guidelines should also be very useful for PWH as \nwell as advocacy organizations.\nKeywords\nbleeding disorders, hemophilia, management guidelines, \nnovel hemostasis products, outcomes, treatment\nThis third edition of the WFH Guidelines for the \nManagement of Hemophilia has been endorsed by the \nAsian-Pacific Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis, \nEuropean Haemophilia Consortium, and National \nHemophilia Foundation (USA).\nWFH GUIDELINES DISCLAIMER \nThe World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) does not \nendorse any particular treatment product or  manufacturer; \nany reference  to a product name is not an endorsement \nby the WFH. The WFH does not engage in the practice of \nmedicine and under no circumstances recommends particular \ntreatments for specific individuals. Guidelines are intended \nfor general information only and are based on population \nlevel research, not for the care or treatment of any particular \nindividual. Guidelines do not replace professional medical \ncare and physician advice and/or product insert information, \nbut should be used to educate and inform shared decision-\nmaking between patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers.\nFurthermore, guidelines may not be complete or accurate \nbecause new research studies may have been published or \ntreatments, devices, or indications approved after the cut-off \ndate for inclusion in these guidelines. Through a comprehensive \nand systematic literature review, WFH evidence-informed \nclinical practice guidelines incorporate data from the existing \npeer-reviewed literature. Although this literature met the pre-\nspecified inclusion criteria for the guideline, and the WFH \nconsidered this scientific content to be the best evidence \navailable for general clinical information purposes at the time \nthe guidelines were developed, this evidence is of varying \nquality and varying methodological rigor.\nThe WFH and its officers, committees, members, \nemployees, and guideline authors and reviewers (“WFH \nParties”) disclaim all liability for the accuracy or completeness \nand disclaim all warranties, express or implied. The WFH \nParties further disclaim all liability for any damages whatsoever \n(including, without limitation, direct, indirect, incidental, \npunitive, or consequential damages) arising out of the use, \ninability to use, or the results of use of a guideline, any \nreferences used in a guideline, or the materials, information, \nor procedures contained in a guideline, based on any legal \ntheory whatsoever and whether or not there was advice on \nthe possibility of such damages.", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604163632", "file_path": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "total_pages": 184, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604163632", "page": 3}}

Pierce2\n1\t Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India\n2\t World Federation of Hemophilia, Montreal, QC, Canada\nWith more than one million print and online distributions in \nsix languages and more than 1000 citations in peer-reviewed \narticles since its publication in 2012, the World Federation of \nHemophilia (WFH) clinical practice resource, Guidelines for \nthe Management of Hemophilia, 2nd edition, has served the \ncommunity of hemophilia care providers and people with \nhemophilia extensively. Endorsed by the International Society \non Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), the WFH guidelines \nwere also the first hemophilia management guidelines to be \naccepted by the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC), \nformerly run by the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality (AHRQ) of the United States Department of Health \nand Human Services (https://www.ahrq.gov/gam/index.html).\nOver the past five years, unprecedented progress has been \nmade not only in the development of newer therapeutics for \nhemophilia, but major paradigm shifts have also occurred in \nmany of the principles governing the planning and philosophy \nof hemophilia treatment. Given the progress in genetic \nanalysis technologies, in addition to much wider access, their \napplications in hemophilia have moved from the research \narena to an increasingly greater role in the management of \npatients and their families. The advent of newer clotting \nfactor concentrates (CFCs) with extended half-life has not \nonly led to decreased burden of care for patients; more \nimportantly, extended half-life CFCs have made it possible to \nmaintain significantly higher factor trough levels on regular \nreplacement therapy than has been possible with standard \nhalf-life CFCs. The bar of hemostatic safety was raised \neven higher with the introduction of non-CFC hemostatic \nagents such as the novel bispecific monoclonal antibody. \nThis agent achieves hemostasis equivalent to approximately \n15% FVIII levels, with subcutaneous administration and \nsubstantially less frequent dosing compared to CFCs. People \nwith hemophilia treated with these newer therapies are now \nable to participate in many more activities than ever before \nwithout fear of bleeding. In addition, structured outcome \nassessment has been a relatively unevolved aspect of the \nmanagement of hemophilia. With greater emphasis over the \npast few years on its significance in routine management of \nhemophilia, several clinimetric instruments are now being \nused for the standardized assessment and documentation of \nboth hemostatic and musculoskeletal outcomes.\nTo acknowledge these advances and establish them \nmore firmly in clinical practice, several modifications have \nbeen made in the third edition of these guidelines. New \nchapters have been added to provide the required detail \nto the following topics: genetic assessment; prophylaxis \nwith hemostatic agents to prevent bleeding; management \nof inhibitors; and assessment of outcomes. An additional \nchapter defines the principles of management of hemophilia \nto provide aspirational benchmarks during the evolution of \nthese services, within the local contexts of countries around \nthe world.\nCertain semantic changes introduced in this edition \nshould be mentioned. The term “episodic” rather than “on \ndemand” has been used to describe any hemostasis therapy \nafter bleeding, as this term better reflects the concept of \nthis practice. In  keeping  with the definition provided by \nthe Scientific Standardization Committee of the ISTH, the \nterm “exposure day” has been replaced with “exposure” to \nencompass all CFC replacement doses administered within \n24 hours.\nTo ensure that bias was avoided as much as possible, a \nrigorous consensus-based methodology was adopted for \nformulating  the final recommendations in these guidelines. \nAn independent methods and process expert, unrelated \nto the field, was appointed alongside the content lead. All \nrecommendations were informed by a comprehensive \nand systematic review of the relevant scientific literature \nand developed through an anonymous modified Delphi \nprocess resulting in evidence-informed consensus-based \nrecommendations. Importantly, in addition to the experts in \nhemophilia care and related clinical disciplines, the Delphi \npanels included well-informed patients who also had the \nopportunity to review the manuscripts  and the literature, and \nvote on the recommendations. All these steps are described \nin detail in the Methodology chapter.\nIt is also important to note that the final chapter drafts \nwere reviewed internally both by the full panel and within \nthe WFH, as well as by external subject experts prior to", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604163632", "file_path": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "total_pages": 184, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604163632", "page": 10}}

All these reviewers have been \nacknowledged at the end of the guidelines along with many \nothers whose contributions have been invaluable to their \ndevelopment. A final round of independent peer review was \nalso conducted by the journal before publication. It is also \nimportant to note that these guidelines have been endorsed \nby the Asian-Pacific Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis, \nEuropean Haemophilia Consortium, and National Hemophilia \nFoundation (USA).\nAs a result of all these modifications, the guidelines have \nbecome more comprehensive than the previous edition. \nHowever, to preserve their easy readability, the text remains \nstructured using short sentences in bullet points. Detailed \nmechanistic explanations or descriptions of the original data \nunderlying recommendations have been avoided. However, \nall relevant references have been cited and are listed at the \nend of each chapter.\nIt is hoped that the clinical care community, for whom \nthese guidelines are primarily intended, will find them even \nmore useful than the previous editions. These guidelines may \nalso serve as a resource to support education, advocacy, and \ndecision-making related to hemophilia treatment and the \ndelivery of care. In addition, they should help identify gaps \nin evidence upon which the recommendations have been \nformulated to help direct appropriate clin ical research in these \nareas.

These emerging \ntherapies offer markedly improved pharmacokinetic (PK) \nprofiles with a very low burden of administration (e.g., \nup to monthly dosing); therefore, they may help reduce \ntreatment burden and increase compliance. These therapies \nare discussed in Chapter 5: Hemostatic Agents, Chapter 6: \nProphylaxis in Hemophilia, and Chapter 8: Inhibitors to \nClotting Factor.\n•\t The development of gene therapies for hemophilia has \nadvanced significantly, with product registration likely \nin the near future.

The factor deficiencies are the result of \npathogenic variants in the F8 and F9 clotting factor genes.\n•\t The best estimates of the prevalence of hemophilia, based \non the most reliable national patient registry data available \nand recent World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) annual \nglobal surveys, indicate that the expected number of males \nwith hemophilia worldwide is 1,125,000, the majority of \nwhom are undiagnosed, including an estimated 418,000 \nmales with severe hemophilia.1\nHemophilia A and B\n•\t Hemophilia A is much more common than hemophilia B. \nHemophilia A is estimated to account for 80%-85% of all \nhemophilia cases; hemophilia B is estimated to account for \n15%-20% of all hemophilia cases. Estimated prevalence is \n17.1 cases per 100 000 males for all severities of hemophilia \nA (6.0 cases for severe hemophilia A) and 3.8 cases per 100 \n000 males for all severities of hemophilia B (1.1 cases for \nsevere hemophilia B).1 Estimated prevalence at birth is 24.6 \ncases per 100 000 males for all severities of hemophilia A \n(9.5 cases for severe hemophilia A) and 5.0 cases per 100 \n000 males for all severities of hemophilia B (1.5 cases for \nsevere hemophilia B).1\n•\t Hemophilia is usually inherited through an X chromosome \nwith an F8 or F9 gene mutation. However, both the F8 \nand F9 genes are prone to new mutations, and about 30% \nof all cases result from spontaneous genetic variants. \nProspective studies report that over 50% of people newly \ndiagnosed with severe hemophilia have no prior family \nhistory of hemophilia.2,3\n•\t Hemophilia usually affects only males who inherit an \naffected maternal X chromosome. Females with hemophilia \n(FVIII or FIX <40 IU/dL) are rare; in such cases, both X \nchromosomes are affected or one is affected and the other \nis inactive. A female with one affected X chromosome is \ncalled a carrier of hemophilia.4\n•\t Hemorrhages, musculoskeletal complications, and other \nsequelae of hemophilia typically occur in males with \nhemophilia but may also occur in a proportion of female \ncarriers. Since the baseline factor levels in carriers may be \nnormal or variably reduced, the symptoms and complications \nof hemophilia are less common in females and are often \noverlooked and underdiagnosed; joint bleeds in carriers \noften remain unrecognized, leading to poorer joint outcomes \ndue to undiagnosed joint problems.

A definitive hemophilia diagnosis \nis based on a factor assay to demonstrate deficiency of \nFVIII or FIX.\n•\t See Chapter 3: Laboratory Diagnosis and Monitoring and \nChapter 4: Genetic Assessment.\nBleeding manifestations\n•\t The characteristic phenotype in hemophilia is the bleeding \ntendency. The severity of bleeding manifestations in \nhemophilia generally correlates with the degree of the \nclotting factor deficiency (see Table 2-1).\n•\t People with mild hemophilia may not necessarily have \nabnormal or prolonged bleeding problems until they \nexperience serious trauma or undergo surgery.\n•\t People with severe hemophilia most commonly experience \nbleeds into the joints, muscles, and internal organs (see \nTables 2-2 and 2-3).\n•\t In newborns and children with severe hemophilia less \nthan 2 years of age, common types of bleeding include6,7:\n\t– soft tissue and intramuscular bleeding;\n\t– bleeding associated with a medical procedure \n(e.g., venipuncture, central line placement, \ncircumcision, neonatal heel prick);\n\t– mucocutaneous bleeding (e.g., oral, nasal);\n\t– extracranial bleeding.\n•\t Some types of bleeds can be life-threatening and require \nimmediate treatment and medical attention.\n•\t See Table 2-2 and Chapter 7: Treatment of Specific \nHemorrhages.\nPatient/caregiver education\n•\t People with hemophilia and family/primary caregivers \nmust receive comprehensive education on hemophilia \ncare, particularly on the prevention and treatment of bleeds \nand management of musculoskeletal complications, and \ntraining on essential skills for self-management, including \nbleed recognition, self-treatment, record-keeping, dental \ncare, and risk management.10,11 (See 2.5 Home therapy – \nSelf-management, below.)\n2.2\t\nComprehensive care\n•\t Comprehensive hemophilia care involves multidisciplinary \nmedical services necessary for the diagnosis, treatment, \nand management of the condition and its complications. \nThese services are typically delivered by a hemophilia \ntreatment centre or hemophilia comprehensive care centre, \nas described in Chapter 1: Principles of Care – Principle 1: \nNational coordination and delivery of hemophilia care. \nComprehensive care promotes physical health, psychosocial \nwell-being, and quality of life for people with hemophilia \nand reduces morbidity and mortality.11-13 It should \nencompass family-centred care, particularly diagnosis \nand management of carriers.11,14\nTABLE 2-1  Relationship of bleeding severity to clotting factor level8\nSeverity\nClotting factor level\nBleeding episodes\nSevere\n<1 IU/dL (<0.01 IU/mL) or <1% of normal\nSpontaneous bleeding into joints or muscles, predominantly \nin the absence of identifiable hemostatic challenge\nModerate\n1-5 IU/dL (0.01-0.05 IU/mL) or 1-5% of normal\nOccasional spontaneous bleeding; prolonged bleeding \nwith minor trauma or surgery\nMild\n5-40 IU/dL (0.05-0.40 IU/mL) or 5-<40% of normal\nSevere bleeding with major trauma or surgery; rare \nspontaneous bleeding", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604163632", "file_path": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "total_pages": 184, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604163632", "page": 23}}

Caution is required \nwhen treating breakthrough bleeding episodes while on \nemicizumab as several patients have developed either venous \nthromboembolism or thrombotic microangiopathy with \nconcomitant administration of activated prothrombin \ncomplex concentrate (aPCC).49 Consult the individual product \ninserts for precautions and risk management guidance.\n•\t See Chapter 5: Hemostatic Agents, Chapter 6: Prophylaxis \nin Hemophilia, and Chapter 8: Inhibitors to Clotting Factor.\nSelf-management\n•\t Self-management focuses on patient empowerment and \nrefers to a patient’s ability to acquire the necessary skills \nand knowledge to become competent in their own care \nand apply it in their daily activities to keep their condition \nunder control and minimize its impacts on their physical \nand psychological health.45 For people with hemophilia, \nself-management requires concrete knowledge of bleeding \nmechanisms and treatment strategies (when and how to \ntreat and what dose to give).45\n•\t The key self-management skills required for people with \nhemophilia include45:\n\t– bleed recognition;\n\t– self-infusion/self-treatment skills;\n\t– self-care (i.e., nutrition and physical fitness) and \nmedicines management (i.e., record-keeping, \ntreatment routines, maintenance of adequate \ntreatment supply, skills in storage, reconstitution, \nand administration of treatment products);\n\t– pain management; and\n\t– risk management and conceptualizing preventive \ntherapy.\n•\t Knowledge of appropriate adjunctive therapies (e.g., \nantifibrinolytics, pain medications) and adjunctive \nmanagement (e.g., the PRICE principles) are also important \nto self-management.\n•\t See 2.3 Fitness and physical activity, 2.4 Adjunctive \nmanagement, and 2.5 Home therapy, above, and 2.6 Pain \nmanagement, below.\nBleed recognition\n•\t Bleed recognition, especially of joint and muscle bleeds, \nis an essential part of self-management so that prompt \ntreatment can be initiated to minimize the shortand long-\nterm impacts of bleeds. In hemophilia, a wait-and-see \napproach for potential bleeds or missed doses may result \nin the onset and progression of bleeding symptoms that \nare not only painful but ultimately lead to joint damage.\n•\t It is important for family members/caregivers to be able \nto recognize subtle signs of bleeds in young children with \nhemophilia; in infants and young children, reluctance to \nuse a limb may be indicative of a joint/muscle bleed.50 \nThe signs and symptoms of common types of hemorrhage \nin hemophilia50 are described in Chapter 7: Treatment \nof Specific Hemorrhages and Chapter 11: Outcome \nAssessment.\n•\t For those on prophylaxis with new types of coagulation \ntherapy, it is important to monitor and assess the ability \nof patients/caregivers to recognize breakthrough bleeds \nand initiate prompt episodic treatment with CFCs or \nappropriate hemostatic agents.\nSelf-infusion/self-treatment\n•\t In young children, injections or infusions are normally \ngiven by the parents and/or caregivers until the child is \nold enough to switch to self-treatment.51\n•\t Children with hemophilia typically learn to self-infuse \nor self-inject in late childhood or early adolescence. Self-\ninfusion requires skill and expertise developed through trial \nand error as well as education and support.45 Becoming \nsufficient at self-infusion is complex as it requires a one-\nhanded technique to perform all steps; however, most \nchildren self-infuse at least part of the time by 12 years \nof age.45\n•\t Establishing routines, such as self-infusing at the same \ntime every day, can help significantly with treatment \nadherence.45\nRECOMMENDATION 2.5.1:\n•\t Patients (or caregivers of children) with hemophilia \nshould be taught how to manage their care at home", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604163632", "file_path": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "total_pages": 184, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604163632", "page": 30}}

(See 2.3 Fitness \nand physical activity, above, 2.7 Dental care and management, \nbelow, and Chapter 9: Specific Management Issues.)\n•\t In addition, healthcare providers can educate and guide \npeople with hemophilia in planning their daily lives to \nreduce bleeding risk. Strategies may include adapting the \ntreatment regimen to fit within other priorities (e.g., school \nand sports), routines, activities, and events in their lives.45\nCentral venous access devices\n•\t An implanted central venous access device can enable stable, \nlong-lasting venous access to make infusions easier and \nmay be required for administering prophylaxis or immune \ntolerance induction (ITI) therapy in young children with \nproblematic venous access.57,58\n•\t The complications and risks associated with surgical \nimplantation of CVADs (i.e., hospitalization, bleeding, \ncatheter infection, thrombosis, breakage, and/or \nmalfunction) need to be weighed against the advantages \nof early initiation of intensive prophylaxis.59-61 Many \npediatricians and hemophilia treaters are shifting from the \nuse of CVADs to peripheral venous access for early initiation \nof prophylaxis, starting with once-weekly prophylaxis then \ngradually escalating infusion frequency,62 together with \nmore intensive caregiver training.\n•\t Alternatively, the use of emicizumab obviates the need \nfor CVADs, and it is increasingly among the treatment \noptions for people with hemophilia A in many countries. \n(See Chapter 6: Prophylaxis in Hemophilia.)\n•\t The protocol used for device care (using aseptic precautions), \nquality of patient/caregiver education, and user compliance \nmay affect frequency of infections; therefore, careful \nguidelines and surveillance protocols are important to \nreduce the risk of complications.59\n•\t Parents and caregivers must be taught to keep CVADs \nscrupulously clean and to flush out the catheter properly \nafter each therapy administration to prevent CVAD infection \nand clot formation.59 Fibrinolytic agents may be helpful \nfor preventing clotting and infections.60\n•\t It is essential to ensure that parents and caregivers have a \nthorough understanding of all aspects of home therapy and \nare prepared and able to handle the issues and challenges \nthat commonly arise in children with hemophilia at each \ndevelopment stage.

When possible, the first visit should be performed \nby both the pediatric and adult hematologists. CB\nRECOMMENDATION 2.8.2:\n•\t For adolescents with hemophilia on prophylaxis, the \nWFH recommends individual education and training, \nideally from a hemophilia nurse coordinator, to ensure \nadequate knowledge of hemophilia, and to support \nprophylaxis adherence and self-care management. \nThis should include understanding measurements of \nadherence, as well as factors and risks that can lead to \nchanges in bleeding rates. CB\nRECOMMENDATION 2.8.3:\n•\t For adolescents 12-18 years of age with hemophilia, \nthe WFH recommends age-specific hemophilia camps \nto foster peer group support and develop their self-\ninfusion skills and understanding of the importance \nof adherence to treatment.

If anti-FVIII antibody is present, the APTT of \nthis mixture will be prolonged with incubation.\n•\t Most FVIII inhibitors that develop secondary to replacement \ntherapy in patients with hemophilia A show a characteristic \npattern: the APTT of a patient/PNP mixture is intermediate, \ni.e., between the APTTs of the two materials, and it is \nfurther prolonged when the mixture is incubated at 37°C \nfor 1-2 hours.\n•\t Confirmation that an inhibitor is directed against a specific \nclotting factor requires a specific inhibitor assay.\n•\t Quantification of the inhibitor titer is performed in the \nlaboratory, preferably using the Nijmegen-modified \nBethesda assay for FVIII inhibitor testing,1 because this \nmodification offers improved specificity and sensitivity \nover the original Bethesda assay.101-109\n•\t The results of Bethesda inhibitor assays can be affected by \nthe use of different dilutions of test sample before those \ndilutions are mixed with normal plasma.110\n•\t For patients treated with FVIII or FIX, washout is no \nlonger necessary if a heat neutralization modification of \nthe Nijmegen-Bethesda assay is used, which inactivates \nFVIII/FIX in the sample to allow detection of the \ninhibitor.109,111-113 This is not required if FVIII/FIX is \n<5 IU/dL in the test sample since this low level will not \nhave a significant effect on inhibitor titer calculations.\n•\t Different types of FVIII assays can be used to determine the \nFVIII during the Nijmegen-Bethesda inhibitor assay.114-118 \nThe protocol for the US national inhibitor program requires \na chromogenic assay to be used when positive FVIII \ninhibitor results below 2.0 BU are observed.108 If there is \nsuspicion of lupus anticoagulant or if the sample contains \ntherapeutic anticoagulants such as heparin or direct FXa \nor FIIa inhibitors, it may be useful to confirm inhibitor \npresence using a chromogenic assay to measure residual \nfactor activity (instead of a one-stage assay).\n•\t An inhibitor titer of ≥ 0.6 BU/mL should be considered \nclinically significant.119,120\n•\t Some non-neutralizing anti-FVIII antibodies which are \nnot detected by the Nijmegen-Bethesda assay may be \nclinically relevant because they may increase the clearance \nof FVIII and can be measured by ELISA.121-128\nRECOMMENDATION 3.2.35:\n•\t For determination of anti-FVIII inhibitors in a sample \ncontaining greater than 5 IU/dL FVIII activity, the \nWFH recommends that prior to testing, the sample \nbe heated to 56°C for 30 minutes and centrifuged at \nambient temperature for a minimum of 1700 g for at \nleast 5 minutes.\n•\t REMARK: The quantification limit of the Nijmegen-\nBethesda FVIII inhibitor assay is around 0.6 BU/mL.\n•\t REMARK: The Nijmegen-Bethesda FVIII inhibitor \nassay requires use of buffered pooled normal plasma \nas a source of FVIII, which is then mixed with an equal \nvolume of FVIII-deficient plasma to prepare the control \nmixture.

There are two \nmain types of CFCs: virally inactivated plasma-derived \nproducts made from plasma donated by human blood \ndonors; and recombinant products manufactured using \ngenetically engineered cells and recombinant technology.\n•\t The development of non-factor replacement therapies such \nas emicizumab has recently begun to offer an alternative \ntreatment approach as such products become available \nin clinical practice.\n•\t However, access to CFCs and emicizumab is limited in \nmany parts of the world; in some countries, healthcare \nproviders often rely on locally produced blood products \nsuch as cryoprecipitate and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for \nhemophilia treatment. However, these blood products \nare less effective than CFCs and may contain viral and \nbacterial pathogens.1,2 For this reason, where available, \nviral-inactivated plasma-derived or recombinant CFCs \nare preferred over cryoprecipitate and FFP.\n•\t Although advances have been made in the safety of such \nblood products, the WFH’s position is that the products \nof choice for hemophilia treatment are industrially \nmanufactured CFCs where they fulfill the requirements \nfor pharmaceutical Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP).2\n•\t The comprehensive WFH Guide for the Assessment of \nClotting Factor Concentrates describes the key elements that \naffect the quality, safety, efficacy, licensing, and regulation \nof factor products and the important principles involved in \nselecting suitable products for the treatment of hemophilia.2\n•\t The WFH also publishes and regularly updates the WFH \nOnline Registry of Clotting Factor Concentrates, which lists \nall currently available products and their manufacturing \ndetails.3\nRECOMMENDATION 5.1.1:\n•\t For patients with hemophilia, the WFH does not express \na preference for recombinant over plasma-derived \nclotting factor concentrates.\n•\t REMARK: The choice between these classes of product \nmust be made according to local criteria including \navailability, cost, and patient preferences.

The \nWFH emphasizes the importance of assessment by the \nofficial agencies responsible for protecting and promoting \npublic health (i.e., national regulatory authorities, health \nagencies, or ministries of health) to ensure the quality, \nsafety, and efficacy of plasma-derived treatment products \nfor hemophilia.2\n•\t Two issues require special consideration:\n\t– purity of product; and\n\t– viral inactivation/elimination.\nPurity\n•\t Purity of CFCs refers to the percentage of the desired \ningredient (i.e., factor VIII [FVIII] or factor IX [FIX]) \nrelative to the other ingredients in the product.\n•\t There is no universally accepted classification of products \nbased on purity, and CFCs on the market vary widely in \ntheir purity. Their “specific activity” may be expressed \nin international units (IU) per milligram (mg) and, for \nexample, can range from 10 to >100 IU/mg for FVIII.4\n•\t Some products have high or very high purity at one stage \nin the production process but are subsequently stabilized \nby albumin, which decreases their final purity.\n•\t In rare cases, lower-purity CFCs may give rise to adverse \nor allergic reactions.5,6 Patients who experience repeated \nallergic reactions with a particular product may benefit \nfrom the administration of an antihistamine immediately \nprior to infusion or from the use of a higher-purity CFC.\n•\t Plasma-derived FVIII CFCs may contain variable amounts \nof von Willebrand factor (VWF). Therefore, it is important \nto ascertain a product’s VWF content (as most commonly \nmeasured by VWF activity assay) if it is used for the \ntreatment of von Willebrand disease (VWD) and not \nhemophilia A.7\n•\t For treatment of FIX deficiency, a product containing \nonly FIX is more appropriate than prothrombin complex \nconcentrates (PCCs). PCCs also contain other clotting \nfactors such as factors II, VII, and X, some of which \nmay become activated during manufacture and may \npredispose the patient to thromboembolism. Current \nPCCs are considered safer than earlier products due to \nthe inclusion of coagulation inhibitors such as heparin, \nantithrombin, and proteins C, S, and Z.8,9 Nevertheless, with \nintensive treatment (e.g., during perioperative management), \nprothrombotic clotting factors may accumulate in the plasma \nand increase the risk for thromboembolic complications.\n•\t The viral safety of CFCs is not related to their purity, \nprovided that adequate viral elimination measures are \nin place.\nViral inactivation/elimination\n•\t In-process viral inactivation is the single largest contributor \nto the safety of plasma-derived CFCs.10\n•\t Typically, two complementary or orthogonal-specific \nviral reduction steps are incorporated into the CFC \nmanufacturing process. These measures should follow \nthe regulations set by official regulatory agencies.\n•\t Solvent-detergent treatment is highly effective against \nlipid-enveloped viruses such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), \nHCV, and HIV, but this treatment does not inactivate non-\nlipid-enveloped viruses such as hepatitis A virus (HAV) \nand human parvovirus B19.\n•\t Heat treatment is generally effective against a broad range \nof viruses, both with and without a lipid envelope, including \nHAV and human parvovirus B19. However, the degree of \ninactivation is dependent upon the temperature, time, and \nwhether heating occurs in the dry or wet state.\n•\t As non-enveloped viruses currently pose a greater challenge \nthan enveloped viruses to viral elimination during the \nmanufacturing process,11 any viral reduction/inactivation \nprocess should ideally inactivate both lipid-enveloped and \nnon-lipid-enveloped viruses.", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604163632", "file_path": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "total_pages": 184, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604163632", "page": 68}}

Bleeding \ndisorders result from a deficiency of the procoagulants, \nwhereas deficiencies of the natural anticoagulants are \nassociated with increased thrombotic risk.\n•\t Hemophilia has typically been treated by replacing the \nmissing procoagulant protein or with bypassing agents \n(i.e., when inhibitors are present). However, inhibiting the \nnatural anticoagulants can also restore hemostasis. This has \nbeen observed naturally as co-inheritance of thrombophilic \nrisk factors can moderate the clinical phenotype of severe \nhemophilia A. In addition, thrombin generation is increased \nwith co-inheritance of hemophilia with some forms of \nthrombophilia (e.g., protein C deficiency).\n•\t Fitusiran is an RNA interference therapy that specifically \ntargets antithrombin messenger RNA to suppress the \nproduction of antithrombin in the liver.77 This therapy has \nthe advantage of subcutaneous administration, prolonged \nduration of action and, due to its mechanism of action, it", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604163632", "file_path": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "total_pages": 184, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604163632", "page": 78}}

Breakthrough bleeding can be \ntreated with FVIII/FIX replacement or with bypassing \nagents, but lower doses must be used to minimize the risk \nof excessive procoagulant activity.\n•\t Anti-TFPI antibodies represent another modality in \nclinical trials. Different anti-TFPI antibodies are currently \nin development, all of which bind to the K2 domain or to \nboth the K1 and K2 domains of TFPI, thus rescuing FXa \nand FVIIa from inhibition.78 These therapies may also \nbe administered subcutaneously and restore hemostasis \nin both hemophilia A and B patients with or without \ninhibitors, but their duration of action is limited by target-\nmediated drug disposition. The use of fitusiran requires \nclose monitoring to minimize risk of thrombosis. Two \nanti-TFPI clinical programs are ongoing, while two others \nhave seen evidence of thrombotic complications. One \nclinical program has been stopped and one halted due to \nthese adverse events.\n•\t See also Chapter 2: Comprehensive Care of Hemophilia, \nChapter 6: Prophylaxis in Hemophilia, Chapter 8: Inhibitors \nto Clotting Factor, and Chapter 9: Specific Management \nIssues.\nReferences\n1.\t\nDi Minno G, Navarro D, Perno CF, et al.

For prophylaxis \nfor patients with inhibitors, see Chapter 8: Inhibitors to Clotting \nFactor.\nAll statements identified as recommendations are consensus \nbased, as denoted by CB.\n6.1\t\nIntroduction\n•\t Prophylaxis in hemophilia consists of regular administration \nof therapeutic products aimed at maintaining hemostasis \nto prevent bleeding, especially joint hemorrhages, which \nwould lead to arthropathy and disability. Prophylaxis \nshould enable people with hemophilia to lead healthy \nand active lives including participation in most physical \nand social activities (at home, school, work, and in the \ncommunity), similar to the non-hemophilic population.\n•\t Prophylaxis with clotting factor concentrates (CFCs) is \nreferred to as regular replacement therapy; it stands in \ncontrast to episodic replacement therapy (also known as \non-demand therapy), which is defined as the administration \nof CFCs only at the time of a bleed.1 Episodic therapy, \nregardless of the doses used, while essential in reducing \nthe pain and debilitating impact of individual bleeds, does \nnot alter the bleeding profile significantly and hence does \nnot change the natural history of hemophilia leading to \nmusculoskeletal damage and other complications due to \nbleeding.\n•\t Therefore, the use of prophylaxis is always recommended \nover episodic therapy. In countries with healthcare \nconstraints and for patients with limited access to CFCs, \nless intensive prophylaxis regimens may be used. (See 6.9 \nHealth economics of prophylaxis.) Still, in all countries \nthe ideal is for patients to not experience any bleeds (i.e., \nachieve “zero” bleeds).\n•\t With the advent of innovative non-factor replacement \ntherapies, which for the most part can be administered \nsubcutaneously, prophylaxis is being redefined as the \nregular administration (intravenously, subcutaneously, \nor otherwise) of a hemostatic agent/ agents to enhance \nhemostasis and effectively prevent bleeding in people \nwith hemophilia.2,3\nRECOMMENDATION 6.1.1:\n•\t For patients with hemophilia A or B with a severe \nphenotype (note that this may include patients with \nmoderate hemophilia with a severe phenotype), the \nWFH strongly recommends that such patients be on \nprophylaxis sufficient to prevent bleeds at all times, \nbut that prophylaxis should be individualized, taking \ninto consideration patient bleeding phenotype, joint", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604163632", "file_path": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "total_pages": 184, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604163632", "page": 82}}

CB\n•\t See 6.9 Health economics of prophylaxis and 6.10 Low-\ndose prophylaxis for patients with limited access to CFCs.\nStandard half-life factor replacement therapy\n•\t Prophylaxis has conventionally been defined as the regular \nintravenous (IV) infusion of the missing clotting factor VIII \n(FVIII) in people with hemophilia A and factor IX (FIX) \nin people with hemophilia B, given in order to increase \nthe FVIII/FIX level with the intent to prevent bleeding.1 \nThe focus of this conventional definition of prophylaxis \nhas been on preventing joint bleeds and maintaining \nmusculoskeletal health.\n•\t The objective of prophylaxis has been to convert a person \nwith severe hemophilia (baseline FVIII/FIX level <1 IU/dL \n[1%]) to a bleeding phenotype typical of moderate or mild \nhemophilia by maintaining factor levels above 1 IU/dL \n(1%) at all times.4\n•\t This was based on the observation that people with \nmoderate hemophilia seldom experienced spontaneous \nbleeding and had much better preservation of joint function.\n•\t However, there has been increasing recognition and \nevidence that factor trough levels of 1-3 IU/dL (1%-3%) \nare insufficient to totally prevent bleeds in all people with \nhemophilia and allow occasional clinical and subclinical \nbleeds, resulting in gradual progression of joint disease \nover a lifespan.5\n•\t In general, the higher the factor levels at all times, the less \nthe bleeding. For every 1% increase in baseline factor levels \n(in people with hemophilia not on prophylaxis), there is a \ndecrease in bleeding frequency, and when baseline FVIII:C \nlevels are above 15 IU/dL (15%), spontaneous bleeding is \nuncommon.6-8 The same is thought to apply with FIX:C \nlevels, although this has been less well studied. Similarly, \nit has been shown that the more time spent with FVIII \nlevels below 1 IU/dL (1%), the higher the rate of break-\nthrough bleeds during prophylaxis.6\nExtended half-life factor replacement therapy\n•\t The use of extended half-life (EHL) CFCs fits within the \ndefinition of conventional factor prophylaxis but allows \nfor more ambitious prophylaxis than simply converting \nan individual from a severe to a moderate phenotype.\n•\t This is particularly the case with some EHL FIX products \nwhich allow individuals to have FIX levels in a non-\nhemophilic range (>40 IU/dL [40%]) for a substantial \nproportion of time and levels in the mild hemophilia range \n(5-40 IU/dL [5%-40%]) just prior to the next infusion.9\n•\t While prophylaxis with CFCs has been the mainstay of \nhemophilia treatment for many decades, the treatment \nlandscape is changing with the development of new types \nof therapies.\nNon-factor replacement therapy\n•\t Non-factor replacement therapy differs from clotting factor \nreplacement therapy in that it provides hemostasis through \na different mechanism than FVIII/FIX replacement. The \nfirst, and at the time of this publication, the only licensed \nnon-factor replacement therapy for hemophilia A is \nemicizumab.10 Emicizumab mimics the cofactor activity \nof FVIII. It is administered subcutaneously once weekly, \nand in some cases can be administered as infrequently \nas once every 2 or 4 weeks.11 (See 6.5 Prophylaxis with \nnon-factor replacement therapy.)\nBasic definitions and concepts in prophylaxis \nwith CFCs\n•\t Prophylaxis has been characterized according to when it \nis initiated and according to its intensity.

The two main ways (high-dose prophylaxis and \nlow-dose escalating prophylaxis) are mainly differentiated \nin the frequency of CFC administration and less so in the \ndoses used.17\n•\t Escalating frequency prophylaxis, which starts with less \nintense prophylaxis (e.g., once-weekly infusions), followed \nby an increase in frequency, has enabled young children \nand their families to gradually adapt to the burdens of \nprophylaxis (e.g., peripheral venous infusion).18,19 Young \nchildren commenced on low-dose escalating prophylaxis \nneed to be followed closely, and strong consideration \nshould be given to escalating prophylaxis quickly (either \nall patients or according to bleeding symptoms) in order \nto prevent bleeding and resulting morbidity.\n•\t Starting with less intense prophylaxis and then gradually \nescalating may improve family acceptance of starting \nprophylaxis early and may improve adherence to \nprophylaxis. This approach also appears to result in less need \nfor placement of central venous access devices (CVADs). \nHowever, patients on less intenseprophylaxis are at a higher \nrisk of bleeding until escalation of prophylaxis occurs.20,21\n•\t For people with hemophilia A, starting with small doses \nof FVIII CFC therapy may have the additional (unproven) \nbenefit of decreasing inhibitor development, as large and \nfrequent doses of FVIII early on have been associated \nwith an increase in the rate of inhibitor development.22\n•\t People with severe/moderate hemophilia who have had a \nlife-threatening bleed in early childhood should, however, \nnot be placed on escalating dose prophylaxis but instead \nbe started immediately on high-dose prophylaxis.\n•\t How to start and when to start prophylaxis with either \nstandard half-life (SHL) or extended half-life (EHL) CFCs \nis not significantly different.

Conventional high-dose and intermediate-dose \nprophylaxis, initiated early in life, have been associated with \nover 90% reduction in joint bleeding rates, annualized joint \nbleeding rates (AJBRs) below 3 per year, and a significant \nreduction in joint deterioration and degenerative joint \ndisease.12,25\n•\t Prophylaxis also provides protection from other types \nof hemorrhages in hemophilia, including preventing or \nsubstantially reducing the risk of intracranial hemorrhage.13\n•\t Longer-term benefits include reduction of chronic \nmusculoskeletal pain, functional limitations and disability, \nneed for orthopedic surgery, hospitalization, emergency \nroom visits, and reduced length of hospital stays; all of this \nleads to greater participation (i.e., regular attendance) in \neducational, recreational, and professional activities, with \nimproved quality of life.26\n•\t Because of these benefits, the World Health Organization \n(WHO), the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH), and \nmany national and international hemophilia organizations \nhave endorsed early prophylaxis as the standard of care \nfor children with a severe phenotype hemophilia27 and \nrecommend that prophylaxis be continued lifelong. \nAdditionally, adults with severe phenotype hemophilia \n(if not already on prophylaxis) should initiate prophylaxis \nas well.22\nProphylaxis using non-factor replacement \ntherapies\n•\t Emicizumab prophylaxis in a number of clinical trials \nhas been shown to be associated with very low rates of \nbleeding (an annualized bleeding rate [ABR] of 1.5) and \nABRs lower than what patients previously reported while \non prophylaxis with CFCs.2 More research is needed \nregarding long-term outcomes with emicizumab.

CB\n6.3\t\nStandard half-life factor prophylaxis\n•\t All SHL CFCs (i.e., plasma-derived and recombinant) \nhave essentially similar pharmacokinetic properties. The \nshort half-life of SHL CFCs results in the need for frequent \nvenipunctures for prophylaxis (3-4 times per week for \nFVIII and 2-3 times per week for FIX); this often leads \nto the need for CVADs in young children and to reduced \nadherence in older children/adults.28\n•\t With SHL CFCs, it is difficult to achieve factor trough \nlevels much higher than 1 IU/dL (1%); to do so would \nrequire very frequent infusions (possibly daily) that many \npatients are likely unwilling or unable to do.\n•\t Individual factor levels in people with hemophilia on \nprophylaxis are determined by:\n\t– the prophylaxis regimen (dose and frequency) that \nindividuals are on;\n\t– their individual pharmacokinetic (PK) handling of \nfactor (factor recovery and half-life/clearance); and\n\t– the PK characteristics of the CFC product used.

Now recognizing \nthat with a 1% trough level, patients remain at risk of \nbleeding, most clinicians would prefer to target higher \ntrough levels (>3%-5%, or higher). Recent studies show \nthat such trough levels achieve less bleeding. However, \nthe trade-off is that higher trough levels may require \nhigher doses or more frequent infusions of clotting factor \nconcentrates. This should therefore be personalized \nbased on the individual’s activities, lifestyle, and PK \nhandling of factor. CB\nTime of day dosing for SHL CFCs\n•\t Timing of prophylactic doses is important particularly for \nconventional CFCs with shorter half-lives (i.e., SHL FVIII/\nFIX). Due to the short half-life of SHL CFCs, conventional \nprophylaxis produces a sinusoidal curve of factor peaks \nand troughs, corresponding to times when patients can \nsafely be more active and times when they cannot.\n•\t As people are more likely to be active during the day, it \nmakes logical sense for most to infuse SHL CFCs in the \nmornings rather than in the evenings.\nRECOMMENDATION 6.3.2:\n•\t For patients who are adherent to their prescribed \nprophylaxis regimen but still experience breakthrough \nbleeds, the WFH recommends escalation of prophylaxis \nwith measurement of trough levels and, if required, \northopedic interventions as appropriate.\n•\t REMARK: Any patient who fails to respond to adequate \nfactor replacement therapy after past responsiveness \nshould be tested for inhibitor development prior to \nescalation of therapy.

By contrast, EHL \nFIX CFCs show greatly improved half-lives (3- to 5-fold \nlonger) in comparison to SHL FIX, but unlike with EHL \nFVIIIs, there are significant differences in the PK properties \nbetween EHL FIX CFCs.9,30-32\nDose\n•\t It is not as yet determined what constitutes high-, \nintermediate-, and low-dose prophylaxis with EHL CFCs \nand whether these definitions should be revised, given that \nmuch higher factor trough levels can be obtained with \nEHL CFCs, particularly with EHL FIXs.

This leads to increased inter-patient and intra-\npatient individualization of prophylaxis as patients age.\n•\t All of the factors described above contribute to the \nwide variability in clinical phenotype among people \nwith hemophilia. This variability in inherent bleeding \nphenotype is demonstrated in the wide range of ages at \nwhich children experience their first joint bleed, which \nmay vary from <1 year to about 6 years with a median of \naround 2 years of age.50 Age at first joint bleed has been \nshown in several studies to predict bleeding phenotype \nin later years as reflected in subsequent annual clotting \nfactor utilization and arthropathy rates, wherein patients \nwho had their first joint bleed at a later age required less \ntreatment and developed less arthropathy.50-53\n6.8\t\nAdherence and patient/caregiver \neducation\n•\t Despite the benefits of prophylaxis, adherence has \ntraditionally been a significant problem. There are many \nreasons for reduced adherence to prophylaxis. The main \nreason is likely the burden of administering CFCs both \nintravenously and frequently. This results in venous access \ndifficulties (particularly in young children but also in \nolder adults with significant arthropathy and potentially \nextinguished veins) and child/family resistance to the \ntime-consuming nature of conventional prophylaxis.\n•\t Another reason for reduced adherence stems from the fact \nthat prophylaxis is designed mainly to prevent long-term \ncomplications from hemophilia. There may be a lack of \ncomprehension on the part of the patient/caregiver of the \nlong-term complications of hemophilia that can occur if \nprophylaxis is not commenced at a young age and a lack of \nappreciation of the benefits of prophylaxis.54 (See Chapter \n2: Comprehensive Care of Hemophilia – Transition from \npediatric to adult care.)\n•\t The consequences of reduced adherence are reduced \neffectiveness of prophylaxis; in the extreme, reduced \nadherence leads to cessation of prophylaxis and places \nthe patient at significant risk of bleeding. This problem of \nreduced adherence is seen in both well-resourced countries \nas well as in countries with more constrained resources.\n•\t With SHL CFCs, missed or delayed prophylaxis doses \nimmediately increase the bleeding risk; thus missed/delayed \ndoses account for a substantial proportion of breakthrough \nbleeds.6 With EHL CFCs, the consequences of a missed \ndose may be even greater; however, there is much more \nmargin for a dose to be simply delayed rather than missed.\nTABLE 6-7  Factors that affect bleeding phenotype and contribute to inter-patient phenotypic \nvariability\nGenetic differences\nNon-genetic differences\n•\t Hemophilic variants\n•\t Levels and patterns of activity\n•\t Levels of other procoagulant and anticoagulant proteins\n•\t Functional ability and physical coordination (i.e., \nstrength, flexibility, balance, stability, mobility)\n•\t Inflammatory responses that might impact a person’s \nsusceptibility to joint damage from bleeding\n•\t Risk-taking behaviors\n•\t Body build (i.e., muscle status)\n•\t Presence or absence of existing target joints or \nestablished hemophilic arthropathy\n•\t Occurrence of trauma", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604163632", "file_path": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "total_pages": 184, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604163632", "page": 92}}

CB\n6.11\t\nNew definitions of prophylaxis\n•\t With emicizumab and potentially with other non-\nfactor therapies in the future, as well as with EHL CFCs \n(particularly EHL FIX), new definitions for prophylaxis \nare required. Modern prophylaxis definitions will need to \nbe inclusive of a wide variety of hemostatic agents with \ndiverse mechanisms of action and modes of administration.\n•\t The WFH proposes the following as a new definition \nof prophylaxis based on outcomes rather than doses of \ntherapeutic products or time for initiation of the treatment \nregimen: the regular administration of a hemostatic agent/\nagents with the goal of preventing bleeding in people with \nhemophilia while allowing them to lead active lives and \nachieve quality of life comparable to non-hemophilic \nindividuals.\n6.12\t\nFuture research questions to be \naddressed\n•\t Prophylaxis in the future will create new challenges and \nneed for research studies, including:\n\t– how to assess the pharmacodynamic effects and \npharmacokinetics of new therapies, considering that \nmonitoring is more complex than simply measuring \nFVIII or FIX levels;\n\t– how to assess the intensity of prophylaxis with \nemicizumab and potentially other non-factor \ntherapies, especially given current challenges in \nmonitoring such therapies;\n\t– how to manage breakthrough bleeds and surgical \nprocedures in patients on prophylaxis with \nemicizumab and potentially other non-factor \ntherapies;\n\t– how best to monitor short- and long-term clinical \noutcomes and adverse events with these new \nproducts as they may be associated with outcomes \nand adverse events not previously encountered;\n\t– how to approach inhibitor development \n(traditionally the greatest threat to managing \nhemophilia) and inhibitor eradication in the face \nof emicizumab and potentially other non-factor \ntherapies;\n\t– how best to select a hemostatic therapy or a \ncombination of therapies tailored to an individual \npatient.\nReferences\n1.\t\nBlanchette VS, Key NS, Ljung LR, et al.

Without adequate treatment, \nsuch internal bleeds may lead to serious complications \nand even become life-threatening.\n•\t Bleeding symptoms and tendencies depend on the patient’s \nhemophilia severity and clotting factor level.\n•\t People with mild hemophilia may not necessarily have \nabnormal or prolonged bleeding problems requiring \nclotting factor replacement therapy until they experience \nserious trauma or undergo surgery. Those with moderate \nhemophilia may experience occasional spontaneous \nbleeding and/or prolonged bleeding with minor trauma or \nsurgery. (See Chapter 2: Comprehensive Care of Hemophilia \n– Table 2-1: Relationship of bleeding severity to clotting \nfactor level.)\n•\t In general, the main treatment for bleeding episodes in \npatients with severe hemophilia is prompt clotting factor \nreplacement therapy and rehabilitation. However, different \ntypes of bleeds and bleeding at particular anatomical sites \nmay require more specific management with additional \nmeasures.

(See 8.2 Inhibitor screening, below.)\n•\t Inhibitors are more frequently encountered in patients \nwith severe disease than in those with moderate or \nmild hemophilia, and more commonly in patients with \nhemophilia A than in those with hemophilia B. Controlling \nbleeds is a greater challenge in hemophilia patients with \ninhibitors than in those without inhibitors. Inhibitors to \nFVIII or FIX are associated with a higher disease burden, \nincluding increased risk of musculoskeletal complications, \npain, physical limitations, and treatment challenges, all of \nwhich may impact a patient’s physical functioning, capacity \nfor physical activities, and quality of life.\n•\t In addition, the immune response to FVIII and FIX products \nis poorly understood and, in the absence of evidence, there \nremain areas of evolving and sometimes ambiguous or \nconflicting information on inhibitor management.\n•\t Furthermore, while new therapies and strategies for inhibitor \ntreatment and eradication are emerging that may offer \nbenefits, the long-term clinical outcomes remain unknown.\n•\t Significant differences exist between hemophilia A and \nhemophilia B regarding inhibitor incidence, management, \nand response to immune tolerance induction (ITI) and \nalternative hemostatic agents. Therefore, in this chapter, \nhemophilia A inhibitors and hemophilia B inhibitors are \ndiscussed separately.\nPatient/caregiver education\n•\t Ongoing patient and family caregiver education and \npsychosocial support are essential components of the \nmanagement of hemophilia patients with inhibitors given \nthe complexity and challenges of this serious complication. It \nis vital for clinicians, patients, caregivers, and the hemophilia \ntreatment centre team to maintain good communication \nthrough a well-coordinated plan of care.", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604163632", "file_path": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "total_pages": 184, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604163632", "page": 108}}

It \nshould be noted the risk of nephrotic syndrome may \nincrease with high-dose ITI. CB\nFIX prophylaxis after immune tolerance \ninduction\n•\t After successful immune tolerization in hemophilia \nB patients with inhibitors (defined as the return to a \npersistently negative inhibitor titer), FIX prophylaxis with \nclose monitoring of clinical response should be initiated.7\nSurgery and invasive procedures\n•\t Inhibitor testing is advised in patients with hemophilia \nB prior to surgery and invasive procedures. Special \nprecautions, as noted above in the “Management of \nbleeding” section, must be taken in hemophilia B patients \nwith inhibitors, including monitoring for allergic reactions \nand nephrotic syndrome.\n•\t In those with low-responding inhibitors, standard FIX \nCFC coverage may be considered if high enough levels \nare achieved. In those with high-responding inhibitors or \nin those with a history of allergic reactions to FIX CFCs, \ntreatment with the bypassing agent rFVIIa is advised, \nrecognizing the risk of an allergic reaction or worsening of \nsuch a reaction in those who experience allergic reactions \nto FIX when treated with aPCC due to its FIX content.\n•\t If hemostasis is unsatisfactory with rFVIIa or aPCC used as \nsingle agents, these agents may be alternated,37 recognizing \nthis is based on a small observational study and also \nrecognizing the risk for allergic reaction or worsening of \nan allergic reaction with aPCC due to FIX content.\n•\t Close perioperative monitoring of clinical response to \nbypass agent therapy is required, particularly for thrombosis \nor consumptive coagulopathy. (See Recommendation 8.4.9 \non clinical monitoring of bypass agent therapy, above.)\n•\t Once hemostasis is achieved and maintained on a bypass \nagent regimen for 3-5 days, use of these agents may be \ntapered over a week or more.\nRECOMMENDATION 8.4.11:\n•\t For patients with hemophilia B and low-responding \nFIX inhibitors who undergo surgery, the WFH has no \npreference for type of FIX products, but recommends \nmore frequent dosing due to the short FIX half-life. CB\nRECOMMENDATION 8.4.12:\n•\t For patients with hemophilia B and FIX inhibitors who \nundergo surgery, the WFH recommends rFVIIa over \naPCC, as aPCC contains FIX and may cause or worsen \nan allergic reaction. CB\nRECOMMENDATION 8.4.13:\n•\t For patients with hemophilia B and inhibitors and an \nallergic reaction to FIX who undergo surgery, the WFH \nprefers rFVIIa over aPCC as aPCC contains FIX and \nmay cause or worsen an allergic reaction.

These \ninclude bleeding and reproductive complications that \nmay affect carriers, specific requirements for surgery and \nother invasive procedures, psychosocial matters, a range of \ncomorbidities due to lifestyle and aging, and other issues.\n•\t As the management of these conditions can sometimes \nbe complex, education aimed at preventing and/or \nappropriately treating the issues discussed in this chapter \nshould be a primary and ongoing focus of collaboration \nbetween people and family members affected by hemophilia \nand their multidisciplinary healthcare team.\n9.2\t\nCarriers\n•\t The most severe forms of hemophilia typically affect males; \nfemales have conventionally been designated as “carriers.”\n•\t Carriers often do not show symptoms of hemophilia \nbecause, although they have an abnormal F8 or F9 gene on \none X chromosome, their other X chromosome contains \na normal F8 or F9 gene that generally works as normal to \nproduce factor levels in the lower limit of the normal range.\n•\t A proportion of carriers have low factor VIII (FVIII) or \nfactor IX (FIX) activity due to lyonization (the random \nsuppression of one of the two X chromosomes; also called \nX inactivation), which can result in mild, moderate, or \neven severe hemophilia in rare instances. Symptomatic \nfemales should be designated as having hemophilia of a \nspecified severity, like males with hemophilia.\nInheritance of hemophilia\n•\t A female who has an F8 or F9 pathogenic variant is called \nan obligate carrier of hemophilia. Obligate carriers can be \nidentified as having a hemophilia gene based on analysis \nof their family history of hemophilia.\n•\t Obligate carriers include:\n\t– any biological daughter of a father with hemophilia;\n\t– any biological mother of a child with hemophilia \nwho also has at least one other family member with \nhemophilia (i.e., her brother, maternal grandfather, \nuncle, nephew, or male cousin) or who is a known \ncarrier of hemophilia (i.e., her mother, sister, \nmaternal grandmother, aunt, niece, or female \ncousin);\n\t– any biological mother of two or more children with \nhemophilia.\n•\t Potential carriers include:", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604163632", "file_path": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "total_pages": 184, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604163632", "page": 122}}

However, some \ncarriers with factor levels in the lower range of normal (i.e., \nbelow 50 IU/dL) experience bleeding problems similar \nto males with mild hemophilia (e.g., hemorrhaging after \ndental extraction, surgery, or trauma) as well as problems \nthat are specific to women, such as prolonged or heavy \nmenstrual bleeding.1\n•\t Carriers who exhibit a greater bleeding tendency than \nwould be predicted by their factor level, as in males, may \nhave a second coagulation defect, such as a von Willebrand \nfactor (VWF) gene variant or a congenital platelet defect.\nRECOMMENDATION 9.2.1:\n•\t Carriers of hemophilia, irrespective of factor level, \nshould be registered at a hemophilia treatment centre. CB\nRECOMMENDATION 9.2.2:\n•\t Carriers of hemophilia with low factor levels should be \ntreated and managed the same as males with hemophilia. \nCB\nCarrier factor level testing\n•\t All immediate female relatives (mother, sister, or daughter) \nof a person with hemophilia should have their factor levels \nmeasured, especially prior to any invasive procedure, \nchildbirth, or as soon as any abnormal bleeding symptoms \noccur.1,2\n•\t In potential carriers, the diagnosis should be confirmed \nby genetic testing, if available, as factor levels may be \nabove 50 IU/dL.3,4\n•\t In some carriers, levels consistent with moderate or even \nsevere hemophilia may be found on factor level testing as \na result of lyonization.5 (See Chapter 2: Comprehensive \nCare of Hemophilia – Table 2-1.)\nRECOMMENDATION 9.2.3:\n•\t All potential and obligate carriers of hemophilia should \nhave their FVIII/FIX levels measured to establish their \nbaseline levels prior to major procedures, surgery, or \npregnancy. CB\nBleeding symptoms\n•\t The most common manifestations among symptomatic \ncarriers include1:\n\t– menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding);\n\t– dysmenorrhea (pain during menstrual bleeding);\n\t– postpartum hemorrhage;\n\t– perimenopausal bleeding (abnormal bleeding during \nthe pre-menopause transition);\n\t– abnormal bleeding alone, following trauma, or after \nmedical interventions (e.g., dental extraction or \nsurgery).\n•\t Hormonal therapy is useful in managing heavy menstrual \nbleeding.6,7 Options include:\n\t– oral, subcutaneous, or transdermal formulations \ncontaining estrogen/progesterone/progestin;\n\t– the levonorgestrel intrauterine device (IUD).\n•\t Oral antifibrinolytics, e.g., tranexamic acid (15-25 mg/kg \nevery 6-8 hours), may also be helpful in managing heavy \nmenstrual bleeding.8\nGenetic counselling\n•\t Genetic counselling is an essential but complex component \nof comprehensive care for individuals and families with a \ndiagnosis of hemophilia and for those at risk.9\n•\t While the scope and availability of services vary among \ncountries10 and individual hemophilia treatment centres,11 \ncomprehensive genetic counselling generally involves9:\n\t– collection and analysis of family and medical \nhistories to assess the chance of disease occurrence;\n\t– education about inheritance, genetic testing, \ntreatment, prevention, and available resources; and\n\t– counselling to promote informed choices and \nadaptation to the risk or condition.\n•\t Genetic counselling should take into account the individual’s \nexperiences and perceptions, as well as the social, cultural, \nand religious factors and contexts that may influence \ndecisions and options related to their genetic status.\n•\t Genetic counsellors can help both obligate and potential \ncarriers of hemophilia understand their bleeding and \ngenetic risks and adapt to the medical, psychological, \nfamilial, and reproductive implications and consequences \nof their genetic status.9\n•\t The primary role of genetic counsellors is to educate \nindividuals on the natural history of hemophilia, establish \ntheir family tree/pedigree, perform risk assessments related \nto the inheritance of hemophilia, facilitate genetic testing, \nhelp them process and integrate genetic information, and \ndiscuss relevant reproductive options.9", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604163632", "file_path": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "total_pages": 184, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604163632", "page": 123}}

Carriers may require referral to psychosocial \nprofessionals (e.g., psychologists) for further support to \naddress psychological or emotional issues that may arise \nduring the genetic counselling process or at different life \nstages.\n•\t Collaboration between psychosocial professionals and \ngenetic counsellors can enhance overall patient care.\n•\t Carriers may experience a wide range of emotional \nand psychosocial impacts, including feelings of guilt, \nsorrow, and self-blame related to reproductive choices or \nconsequences such as passing on their genetic variant.12 \nSuch feelings run across generations of a family and may \nalso be experienced by grandmothers who were carriers \nand fathers with hemophilia.12\n•\t It is important for hemophilia treatment centres and \nhealthcare providers (especially genetic counsellors and \nclinical geneticists), families, and patient organizations \nto be aware that the experience of being a hemophilia \ncarrier may change with different life stages, and carriers \nmay need genetic and/or psychosocial counselling more \nthan once during their lifetime.12\n•\t Comprehensive genetic counselling including a formalized \nsystem for the education, management, follow-up, and \nlong-term medical and psychosocial support of carriers \nshould be implemented.10\nGenetic testing\n•\t Genetic testing facilitates identification of carriers and \nprenatal diagnosis.

It is important to have a clear plan for delivery that \nis shared with the carrier and written in her medical file.\nFactor levels during pregnancy\n•\t During pregnancy, FVIII levels can increase significantly \nin carriers and may completely normalize in the later \nstages. Levels of FIX, however, do not usually change \nsignificantly.14\n•\t Even with factor levels above 50 IU/dL in the third \ntrimester, carriers may experience abnormal bleeding \nduring childbirth; therefore, it is critical to obtain a carrier’s \nbleeding history and score, family history of bleeding, and \nhistory of bleeding with past childbirth prior to delivery15 \nand, if possible, prior to pregnancy.\nRECOMMENDATION 9.2.5:\n•\t Pregnant carriers of hemophilia should have their FVIII/\nFIX levels assayed in the third trimester of pregnancy \nto assess their bleeding risk during delivery and in the \npostpartum period.

Some suggest caesarean delivery to \nprevent intracranial hemorrhage in an infant expected to \nbe born with severe hemophilia.18\n•\t Delivery of infants known or suspected to have hemophilia \nmust be atraumatic, regardless of whether it is by vaginal \nor caesarean delivery, to decrease the risk of bleeding \ncomplications.14\n•\t Forceps and vacuum extraction vaginal delivery as well as \ninvasive procedures to the fetus such as fetal scalp blood \nsampling and internal fetal scalp electrodes should be \navoided.19\n•\t See Chapter 7: Treatment of Specific Hemorrhages – Table \n7-2 for CFC replacement for major and minor surgery.\nRECOMMENDATION 9.2.6:\n•\t For pregnant carriers of hemophilia, delivery should \nbe in a hospital with access to hemophilia specialists \nwhere complications during labour and delivery can be \ndealt with promptly to maintain the safety of mother \nand child. CB\nRECOMMENDATION 9.2.7:\n•\t For pregnant carriers of hemophilia, the WFH \nrecommends against instrumental delivery. CB\nPostpartum care\n•\t Carrier FVIII and VWF levels fall off fairly rapidly after \ndelivery,5 usually returning to baseline levels in 7-10 days, \nbut sometimes earlier.20\n•\t It is important to monitor and maintain factor levels \npost-delivery as carriers are at increased risk of primary \nand secondary postpartum hemorrhage.21 If postpartum \nhemorrhage occurs, factor replacement therapy, \nantifibrinolytics (tranexamic acid), and hormonal therapy \nare the first-line therapies for its management.5\n•\t Prophylactic hormonal therapy may be started immediately \nafter delivery and continued for one month in selected \ncarriers deemed to be at higher risk of bleeding.5\n•\t Desmopressin (DDAVP) is occasionally used in the \npostpartum period for hemophilia A.5 (See Chapter 5: \nHemostatic Agents – Other pharmacological options – \nDesmopressin [DDAVP].)\n•\t Hemoglobin levels in carriers at risk of late postpartum \nhemorrhage should be checked before discharge from \nhospital.22\n•\t Delayed bleeding up to 35 days postpartum is possible; \ncarriers must be informed of this risk and should be seen \n2 weeks postpartum. Follow-up to monitor postpartum \nbleeding for approximately 1-2 months may be appropriate.22\nRECOMMENDATION 9.2.8:\n•\t Carriers of hemophilia should be monitored for both \nprimary and secondary postpartum hemorrhage, which \nshould be treated with appropriate hemostatic measures. \nCB\nNewborn testing\n•\t Cord blood should be collected from all male newborn \ninfants of carriers of hemophilia to assess clotting \nfactor levels for early identification and management of \nhemophilia. The test results should be conveyed to the \nparents by an appropriate member of the hemophilia team.\n•\t Normally in newborn and pre-term infants without \nhemophilia, FVIII levels at birth are within the normal \nadult range or mildly increased. Therefore, it is possible to \ndiagnose most cases of hemophilia A at birth; the exception \nbeing in mild hemophilia A, wherein a FVIII result at the \nlower end of the normal range should be repeated when \nthe infant is around 6 months of age.23\n•\t In contrast to FVIII, FIX levels at birth are significantly \nlower than normal in newborns without hemophilia and \neven more so in preterm infants.23 While it is usually \npossible to make a diagnosis of severe or moderate \nhemophilia B in the neonatal period, infants who may \nbe mildly affected will require repeat screening at 3-6 \nmonths of age.\nRECOMMENDATION 9.2.9:\n•\t Male babies born to known or potential carriers of \nhemophilia should have cord blood testing of activated \npartial thromboplastin time (APTT) or factor levels. CB\nMiscarriage management\n•\t Miscarriage refers to a spontaneous abortion or pregnancy \nloss before 20 weeks of gestation24,25 by complete or \nincomplete expulsion of the products of conception from \nthe uterus, by failure of the embryo to develop, or by death \nof the fetus in utero.25\n•\t Once the determination has been made that the pregnancy \nhas ended because the embryo or fetus has died or because \na miscarriage is in progress, the obstetrician will surgically \nevacuate the uterus or await spontaneous expulsion of the \nproducts of conception.\n•\t Surgical management of spontaneous abortion is preferred \nin patients with a pre-existing hemostatic abnormality \nsuch as an inherited bleeding disorder.24 In such cases, \nadequate hemostatic treatment is required in accordance \nwith the recommended perioperative protocols.

It has \nbeen suggested that therapeutic doses of anticoagulants \nmay be administered when deficient clotting factor levels \nare maintained above 30 IU/ dL44 or above 15 IU/dL.54\n•\t Hemostatic response to bypassing agents is often \nunpredictable; therefore, antithrombotics should only \nbe used in patients with hemophilia and high-responding \ninhibitors who are at the highest risk of developing \nthromboses. In rare cases, the risk of untreated thrombosis \nmay outweigh the risk of bleeding complications and \ntherefore justify the use of antithrombotic agents.

This leads to complications such as chronic \nsynovitis and hemophilic arthropathy.1,2 For discussion \nand recommendations on joint bleeds, see Chapter 7: \nTreatment of Specific Hemorrhages and Table 7-2.\n•\t Inadequate treatment of intramuscular bleeds can lead \nto muscle contractures, especially in bi-articular muscles \n(e.g., calf and psoas muscles), often within the first decades \nof life.1,2 Other more serious complications such as \ncompartment syndrome and pseudotumours may also \ndevelop. (See “Clotting factor replacement therapy” and \n10.5 Pseudotumours, below.)\n•\t Prophylaxis to prevent bleeding episodes is considered \nthe standard of care to the extent that resources permit.4\n•\t Successful treatment to achieve complete functional \nrecovery generally requires a combination of clotting \nfactor concentrate (CFC) replacement therapy or other \nhemostatic coverage (e.g., bypassing agents for patients \nwith inhibitors) and physical therapy.\nPatient/caregiver education\n•\t Patient education on musculoskeletal issues in hemophilia \nis critical and should encompass joint and muscle health, \nrecognition and treatment of musculoskeletal bleeds, \npain management, musculoskeletal complications, and \nthe importance of physical therapy and rehabilitation. A \nmultidisciplinary approach to addressing the bleed and its \nconsequences is essential.5 (See Chapter 2: Comprehensive \nCare of Hemophilia.)\n10.2\t\nSynovitis\n•\t Following acute hemarthrosis, the synovium becomes \ninflamed, hyperemic, and friable. This acute synovitis can \ntake several weeks to resolve.2,6,7\n•\t Failure to manage acute synovitis results in recurrent \nhemarthroses and subclinical bleeds1,2; the synovium \nbecomes chronically inflamed and hypertrophic, and the \njoint becomes prone to further bleeding.

It is assessed by \nclinical evaluation including the use of generic and disease-\nspecific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) assessment \ninstruments, measures of patient-reported outcomes \n(PROs), and laboratory tests including imaging studies.2-7 \nThese instruments measure a variety of parameters including \nactivities and participation, body structure and function, \nburden of disease, and subjective health status, as described \nlater in this chapter.\n•\t Both generic and hemophilia-specific assessment \ninstruments make it possible to evaluate the nature of \nthe physical impairments and functional limitations and \ntheir impacts on the lives of people with hemophilia and \ntheir families.1\n•\t The increasing use of these instruments will standardize \nassessment and permit comparison of data between \nindividuals and cohorts.8-10\nPurposes of outcome assessment\n•\t Outcome assessment may be used to follow an individual’s \ndisease course, obtain information to guide routine clinical \ncare, measure response to therapy, and determine whether \nthere is a need to modify therapy. Outcome assessment may \nalso be used to quantify the health of a group of patients, \nmeasure quality of care, and advocate for resources.\n•\t In addition, outcome assessment may be used for research \npurposes such as to document the natural history of the \ndisease, test new therapies, or compare different therapies.\n•\t Health outcome research may be used to inform decisions \nregarding expenditures on treatment.\n11.2\t\nOutcome assessment in hemophilia\n•\t Outcome assessment in hemophilia should cover two \naspects: disease-related and therapy-related outcomes.\n•\t Disease-related outcomes pertain to the effectiveness of \nhemostatic therapy and are reflected in outcomes such as:\n\t– frequency of bleeding; and\n\t– impact of bleeding on the musculoskeletal system \nand other systems in the short and long term, \nincluding the psychosocial impact of hemophilia.\n•\t Therapy-related outcomes need to be monitored using \na prospective and systematic plan and should include \nscreening and testing of people with hemophilia treated \nwith clotting factor concentrates (CFCs) for inhibitor \ndevelopment. (See Chapter 8: Inhibitors to Clotting Factor.)\n•\t Other less common complications of CFC replacement \ntherapy include thrombosis and allergic/anaphylactic \nreactions.

(See Chapter 2: Comprehensive Care \nof Hemophilia – Home therapy – Self-management.)\n•\t In particular, bleeding into the central nervous system \n(CNS) requires documentation because of its potential \nimpact on neurological and musculoskeletal functions.\n•\t Given the potential difficulties in clinical determination \nof joint and muscle bleeding and to bring consistency into \ndocumenting this important parameter, criteria defined \nby the Scientific and Standardization Committee of the \nInternational Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis \nshould be followed.11\n•\t A joint bleed is defined as an unusual sensation “aura” \nin the joint, in combination with any of the following11:\n\t– increasing swelling or warmth of the skin over the \njoint;\n\t– increasing pain; or\n\t– progressive loss of range of motion or difficulty in \nusing the limb as compared with baseline.\n•\t A muscle bleed is defined as an episode of bleeding into a \nmuscle, determined clinically and/or by imaging studies, \ngenerally associated with pain and/or swelling and loss of \nmovement over baseline.11\n•\t In infants and young children, reluctance to use the limb \nalone may be indicative of a joint or muscle bleed.11\n•\t Definitions for effectiveness of hemostatic therapy for joint \nand muscle bleeds have been developed and should be used \nwhen documenting treatment outcomes.

Late \nosteochondral changes may be assessed on plain \nradiographs.\n\t– Functional activity levels should be assessed \nusing the most appropriate option available \nfor that individual, including the Haemophilia \nActivities List (HAL), the Haemophilia Activities \nList for children (PedHAL), or the Functional \nIndependence Score in Hemophilia (FISH).\n\t– HRQoL is an important aspect of outcome \nmeasurement that may be assessed using either \ngeneric or disease-specific tools, but only in \ncombination with the other domains of the WHO \nICF. CB\n11.8\t\nPatient-reported outcomes\n•\t Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) provide a report of the \nstatus of a patient’s health condition that comes directly \nfrom the patient, without interpretation of the patient’s \nresponse by a clinician or anyone else.70\n•\t It encompasses both single-dimensional and multi-\ndimensional measures of symptoms, HRQoL, health \nstatus, adherence to treatment, satisfaction with treatment, \nand other measures.71\n•\t PROs include generic instruments such as EQ-5D-5L, Brief \nPain Inventory v2 (BPI), International Physical Activity \nQuestionnaire (IPAQ), Short Form 36 Health Survey v2 \n(SF-36v2), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement \nInformation System (PROMIS),71,72 and disease-specific \ninstruments such as the HAL,73 HRQoL measures such as \nCHO-KLAT,66 HAEMO-QoL-A,5 and burden of disease \nquestionnaires such as PROBE.6\n•\t While data generated by a PRO instrument can provide \nevidence of a treatment benefit from the patient perspective, \nthe choice of instrument should be tailored to the study \ndesign or clinical need for specific outcome assessment, \nrather than just psychometric properties of the instrument.74\n11.9\t\nCore set of measures for use in the \nclinic or research setting\n•\t In health care, the focus is increasingly shifting from \nthe volume of services delivered to the value created for \npatients. In this context, value is defined as outcomes \nachieved relative to costs.75\n•\t While many outcome assessment options have been \ndescribed here, in practice, hemophilia treatment centres \nand clinicians may select the instruments most appropriate \nfor their patients. Outcome assessment instruments may \nbe classified as mandatory, recommended, and optional.1\n•\t To extract the potential of value-based health care, \nstandardized outcome measures must be encouraged.\n•\t This will mean committing to measuring a minimum \nsufficient set of outcomes for every major medical condition, \nwith well-defined methods for their collection, which will \nthen need to be applied universally.\nTABLE 11-8  36-Item Short Form Survey \nInstrument (SF-36)69\nItems (n)\nSF-36 overall\n36\nSF-36 domains\nPhysical functioning \n10\nRole limitations due to physical health \nproblems \n4\nRole limitations due to personal or \nemotional problems\n3\nEnergy/fatigue \n4\nEmotional well- being \n5\nSocial functioning \n2\nPain\n2\nGeneral health \n5", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604163632", "file_path": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "total_pages": 184, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604163632", "page": 164}}

For this third edition, the WFH decided to adopt \na different method for development, incorporating evidence-\nbased and Trustworthy Consensus-Based Statement (TCBS)3 \napproaches in conformance with established international \nstandards for clinical practice guidelines.4,5\nIn rare diseases such as hemophilia,6 there are limitations \nin developing evidence-based guidelines due to gaps in \nthe evidence base related to small sample sizes and the \npaucity of methodologically rigorous data stemming from \nrandomized controlled trials. The wide range of hemophilia \ntreatments and practices used globally also contributes to \nthe disparate research foci in the current state of hemophilia \nscience. Quantitative analyses of the data for several aspects \nof management (e.g., direct meta-analyses or network meta-\nanalyses) are not feasible under these circumstances.\nWhen the evidence is not sufficiently evolved to support \nquantitative analyses for evidence-based recommendations, \nit is important to provide physicians and other healthcare \nproviders, people with hemophilia, and advocates with advice \nthey can trust.4,7 The TCBS approach3 produces unbiased, \nscientifically valid, and trustworthy recommendations through \na transparent process that incorporates both the available \nevidence, identified using a systematic approach to reduce \nbiases, and expert clinical advice.\nThis chapter describes the methodology used to develop \nthe third edition of the WFH Guidelines for the Management \nof Hemophilia.\n12.2\t\nMethodology\nThe TCBS process produces evidence-informed \nrecommendations supported by a comprehensive and \nsystematic search for relevant scientific literature, which is \nfirst screened based on predetermined inclusion/exclusion \ncriteria, then followed by data extraction of the available and \nrelevant evidence. The Delphi technique is a widely used and \nwell-accepted process for soliciting feedback and achieving \nconsensus.8 There are several variations,9-12 but the modified \nDelphi approach for guideline recommendations allows \nconsideration of the evidence base as well as expert opinion \nwhile suppressing the introduction of group interaction \nbias. The WFH adopted the TCBS approach, already in use \nby several medical professional societies,13,14 as this type \nof guideline brings thoroughness and transparency to the \nguideline development process for the expert panel’s evidence-\ninformed and consensus-based recommendations.7 As with \nfully evidence-based guidelines, the TCBS approach includes \na rigorous review of both methods and content by internal", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604163632", "file_path": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "total_pages": 184, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604163632", "page": 168}}

This approach is based \non five important pillars:\n•\t confidence in the panel composition and screening;\n•\t systematic and comprehensive evidence searches;\n•\t formal consensus achievement;\n•\t transparency of data and methods throughout; and\n•\t rigorous review process.\nComposition of the panels: structure and \nreview\nThe WFH appointed an overall content lead (AS) and an \nassistant content lead (GP), both highly experienced in the \nfield of hemophilia, and a methodology consultant (SZL) with \nextensive experience in developing guidelines and expertise \nin the TCBS approach. A WFH Guidelines Process Task Force \n(GPTF) was established to provide objective oversight of the \nprocess. The GPTF was composed of members of the WFH \nEducation Committee, including patients and a hematologist \nnot involved in the development of the guidelines.\nThe content lead and the previous WFH Vice President, \nMedical, offered initial invitations to the expert and \nrepresentative panel to meet the criteria described below. \nAn important goal, not always achieved by guideline and \nresearch organizations,15 was to ensure that no serious \ntopic-related conflicts of interest existed for the leads and to \nminimize the percentage of the panel with relevant conflicts. \nThis third edition of the WFH guidelines comprises an \nextensive revision of the existing seven chapters of the 2012 \nedition, as well as several new chapters. Each chapter was \nassigned to a panel composed of 7-10 members, including a \nchapter lead, healthcare professionals with clinical expertise, \nand patients/caregivers, with the latter making up at least 25% \nof each chapter panel. A total of 50 panelists were assigned \nto the 11 content chapters, with some panelists serving on \nmore than one panel. The WFH drew upon its international \nvolunteers and wide stakeholder network to recruit experts \nfrom diverse healthcare disciplines (hematologists, orthopedic \nsurgeons and other musculoskeletal specialists, physical and \noccupational therapists, laboratory scientists, nurses, dentists, \nand psychosocial professionals). The panel also included \na broad representation of people living with hemophilia \nincluding those with related complications such as inhibitors, \nmusculoskeletal complications, and diverse comorbidities, \nas well as parents of children living with these conditions. \nPanelists were recruited from diverse demographic, geographic, \nand socioeconomic contexts to ensure the global relevance \nof these guidelines.\nProcess for panel workflow and oversight\nThe content and chapter leads guided the panels through \nthe chapter development process and provided content \nexpertise. The responsibilities of the chapter leads, with \nhelp from other healthcare professionals on their panels, \nincluded developing a comprehensive set of important \nsubtopics per chapter, advising the medical librarians on \nrelevant search terms, drafting initial recommendations, and \ndeveloping the manuscripts including citation of important \nresearch. The responsibilities of the chapter leads also included \nensuring that the patient/ caregiver panelists’ perspectives \nwere solicited and addressed. Even though the vast majority \nof recommendations address the care and management of \npatients, rather than treatments, content and chapter leads \nalso ensured that no specific products or brand names were \nmentioned; with the exception of the Laboratory Diagnosis \nand Monitoring chapter, wherein the therapeutic products \nmay not be recognized by their international nonproprietary \nnames (INN) by the community and brand names were \nincluded for all products, without which medical errors \ncould inadvertently be made. For the diagnostic reagents, the \nspecific brand names for which published evidence of assay \nvalidation is available were included within each category \nof the reagents.\nAll panelists were involved throughout topic organi-\nzation, evidence generation, consensus achievement of \nrecommendations, and manuscript drafting and reviews. \nMeetings, communications, and trainings were conducted via \nvideoconferences, emails, and electronic surveys. Recordings \nand slides of training sessions and calls were made available \nto all members afterward. All panelists were afforded the \nopportunity to review all of the chapters before finalization \nand external reviews.\nThe equal status of all panelists (whether healthcare \nprofessional or patient/caregiver), the importance of each \nindividual’s expertise, and the imperative for all panelists to \nwork together to solicit and validate all perspectives were \nemphasized in the trainings. Under the direction of the \nGPTF, a patient partner facilitator was hired to contribute \ntraining on the value that this approach adds to guideline \ndevelopment and the practicalities of its application, and \nassist with the implementation of this philosophy. The patient \npartner facilitator supported the patient/caregiver panelists \nthroughout the guideline development process with monthly \ncalls and guidance and non-financial support as needed.", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604163632", "file_path": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "total_pages": 184, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604163632", "page": 169}}

Separate systematic reviews of the \npublished literature were conducted on 10 of the 11 content \nchapters. A review of the literature was deemed not relevant for \none chapter, Principles of Care, which focuses on ideal goals \nand aspirations given the current understanding of hemophilia \nand available science and technologies. Additional searches \nwere developed specifically to target dental procedures, \nplanned and emergent surgical and invasive procedures, \nand the emerging area of genetic assessment, resulting in a \ntotal of 11 reviews conducted. Details of the search strategies, \nthe Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and \nMeta-Analyses (PRISMA), and the extracted evidence are \nprovided in the online supplemental materials.\nStudy eligibility criteria\nPopulation, interventions, comparisons, and \noutcomes\nFor all chapters, studies that included patients with hemophilia \nA or B were retained. Additional population criteria were \nestablished for each chapter. There were no exclusions based \non sex or age. Eligibility of included studies was not restricted \nby interventions, comparisons, or outcomes for any content \narea.\nSearch strategies and information sources\nAll search strategies were developed by a medical librarian \nin collaboration with content experts involved in each of \nthe chapters and the overall content lead. All searches were \nrestricted to English language and human-only studies. No \nexclusions based on geography or type of care setting were \nimplemented. Searches were run in PubMed, the Cochrane \nDatabase of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), the Cochrane \nCentral Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and \nEMBASE, covering the period from January 1, 2000, to \nthe date of the search between May and November 2019. \nThe complete search strategies can be found in the online \nsupplemental materials.\nNo crawling or searching of reference lists of identified \nsystematic reviews was conducted. One exception was made \nfor the new review on Outcome Assessment, for which the \nreference list of one generally well-respected landmark paper \nwas crawled. Chapter leads and panelists were invited to \npropose any directly relevant literature that was not identified \nthrough formal searching to be reviewed for inclusion.\nSetting and study designs\nDue to the volume of literature identified, post hoc restrictions \non included studies (e.g., by publication year and study \ndesign) were applied without knowledge of the literature \nidentified. Most studies selected for extractions were limited to \npublication dates after January 1, 2010 (preceding the search \ndate limit for the previous edition of the guidelines), with the \nexception of the new chapter on Outcome Assessment, for \nwhich the inclusion date extended back to January 1, 2005. \nAdditional papers and qualitative reviews were referenced \nwhen relevant, but data extraction was not performed. Study \ndesigns retained were randomized controlled trials, quasi-\nrandomized controlled trials, and prospective comparative \nstudies. In some cases, retrospective studies were included at \nthe request of individual chapter leads. Some included studies \nwere later confirmed as retrospective during extraction. \nThese were retained in the evidence tables and marked as \nretrospective in the study design column. Cross-sectional \nstudies were included in the evidence base for the Laboratory \nDiagnosis and Monitoring chapter. Systematic reviews were \nincluded for reference only.\nStudy selection\nFor each of the 11 search strategies, screening criteria were \ndeveloped based on pre-specified criteria as defined during \nthe chapter’s search development calls and in collaboration \nwith the chapter leads. Identified references were screened for \nchapter-specific eligibility using the reference management \nsoftware Distiller SR®.\nA team of seven trained reviewers screened titles and \nabstracts. Pilot testing was conducted prior to screening \nof each chapter, with all reviewers screening the same 50 \nreferences, followed by discussions and modifications to \nthe screening forms when required for clarification. The \nremainder of title and abstract screening was completed \nby single review for all chapters. Dual screenings were not \nperformed. For 8 of the 11 chapters, a secondary round of title \nand abstract screening of those studies deemed potentially \neligible was conducted for two reasons. First, as the screening \nteam became more familiar with the literature identified \nby the searches and through further discussions with the \nchapter and content leads, additional screening criteria \nwere applied for subsequent rounds of review.

Second, \na secondary title and abstract screening allowed the team to \nefficiently eliminate irrelevant references, providing time- \nand cost-saving measures. References not eliminated during \ntitle and abstract screening were reviewed for eligibility at \nfull-text screening.\nFor further details related to the flow of references in \nPRISMA diagrams, please see the online supplemental \nmaterials.\nData extraction and development of evidence \ntables\nEvidence tables were created for each chapter. Relevant \noutcomes were determined with the help of the chapter leads.\nA senior methodologist (TS) provided oversight \nand organization of the evidence tables. A team of 15 \nmethodologists and data analysts extracted the relevant \ndata from all included studies. Dual extractions were \nnot performed. The evidence tables and the underlying \nresearch articles for each chapter were shared with the entire \nchapter panel and used by the chapter leads and healthcare \nprofessionals to inform the recommendations. The evidence \ntables are available in the online supplemental materials.\nRisk of bias in individual studies\nNo formal quantitative analyses were conducted, and no \ncritical assessments were made of individual study quality. It \nshould be noted that hemophilia is classified6 as a rare disease \nwhich results in inherent limitations of primary research \nstudies; thus, most assessments would have resulted in low \nor very low levels of evidence. Other than the study design \nlimitations placed on the literature search and screenings, no \nadditional exclusions were made based on methodological \nquality of the research studies.\nBy design, no recommendations were graded as the vast \nmajority of the evidence base in the field, given the barriers \nto clinical research and data collection in rare diseases, is \ninsufficient to support meta-analyses. Grading is based \non two components, the quality of the evidence and the \nbalance of benefits to harms and/or risks. The former is an \nassessment of the quality of the evidence supporting the \nrecommendations specific to each outcome. When low-level \nevidence is partitioned by outcomes, the remaining data are \nnot feasible to support quantitative analyses. Attempting to \ngrade such recommendations can be misleading to the target \naudience of healthcare providers.16 The second component is \nnot explicit in the absence of the quality assessments, so we \ndid not assign a level of strength to the recommendations. \nTherefore, in the interest of transparency, the WFH guideline \nrecommendations were not graded but were clearly marked \n“CB” for consensus-based.\n12.4\t\nFormal consensus achievement \nthrough Delphi techniques\nA priori rules and processes\nFollowing the drafting of the recommendations by the assigned \nhealthcare professionals, each set of recommendations went \nthrough the modified Delphi consensus process.\nSeveral a priori decisions guiding the modified Delphi \nprocess were determined by the GPTF:\n•\t Up to three rounds of Delphi surveys were \npermitted to achieve consensus.\n•\t The minimum response rate for each survey round \nwas set at 75% of eligible voting panelists.\n•\t The threshold for achieving consensus was 80% of \nthe respondents indicating agreement or strong \nagreement.\n•\t Statements achieving consensus in the first or \nsecond round were not subjected to subsequent \nrounds.\n•\t No minority reports were permitted.\nDrafted recommendations that did not achieve consensus \nafter three rounds do not appear as recommendations in \nthe final guidelines. However, the underlying topics may \nbe included in the relevant chapter text, often with a call \nfor additional research in these areas to help resolve some \nof the controversies.\nDelphi surveys\nThe modified Delphi surveys were conducted using \nSurveyMonkey, with all responses remaining anonymous \nexcept to the independent administrator (MG) who created \nand managed the process. All panelists received two trainings \non the TCBS approach, written reminders of the Delphi process \nand rules, and instructions on the first page of the surveys.\nThe initial recommendations were drafted by the \nhealthcare professionals, as assigned by the chapter leads. \nRecommendations were based on the evidence provided in \nthe evidence tables and articles, as well as on the experience \nand expertise of the panelists. Panelists were trained in writing \nrecommendations.

They were not \npermitted to discuss the drafted recommendations so as to \navoid the occurrence or even perception of group interaction \nbias. Panelists were permitted to suggest topics for additional \nrecommendations that did not appear in the list. When new \ntopics were suggested, the assigned healthcare professionals \nfor that chapter’s section were tasked with drafting new \nrecommendations to address the identified gaps.\nPanelists were encouraged to respond completely to \nall recommendations in every round of the surveys. The \nhealthcare professionals were advised to base their level \nof agreement or disagreement on the evidence and their \nexperience treating patients with hemophilia. The patient/\ncaregiver panelists were asked to make similar judgments based \non the evidence and their experience as hemophilia patients/\nfamily caregivers in the healthcare system. These guidelines \nbenefitted from the experiences of patient/caregiver panelists. \nHowever, some expressed hesitation about being asked to \nvote on recommendations for which they did not have any \nexpertise or experience. Therefore, if the recommendation \naddressed an area in which the patient/caregiver panelists \nwere not familiar, they could opt out of the denominator by \nvoting neutral and adding the phrase “No experience in this \narea” in the comments field. This signaled that their neutral \nvote should not be added to the denominator when the votes \nwere tallied. Across all chapters, 53 of 344 recommendations \n(15%) achieved consensus with at least one patient/caregiver \npanelist selecting this option. These choices were made \nselectively by individual patient/caregiver panelists on a \nrecommendation-by-recommendation basis and did not \nimpact the votes of others.\nFor recommendations that did not achieve consensus in \nthe first or second round, the chapter leads drafted revisions \nbased on the comments provided by the respondents. The \nrevised recommendations were submitted for the next \nround of voting. The topics of any recommendations that \ndid not achieve consensus by the end of the third round \ncould be noted in the manuscripts along with calls for future \nresearch in the respective areas. After all Delphi rounds were \ncompleted, consensus was not achieved for 13 (<4%) of the \nrecommendations. Research funding agencies are encouraged \nto prioritize these areas to address knowledge gaps.\nSurvey tallies with the degree of consensus for \neach recommendation are available upon request \n(research@wfh.org).\nDiversions from the process\nThere were a few diversions from the described process \nrequiring additional surveys after the third round. One \nrecommendation in the muscle hemorrhage section of the \nTreatment of Specific Hemorrhages chapter was resubmitted \nfor voting because new evidence (albeit low level) was brought \nforth that raised doubts about the timeframe specified in the \nrecommendation. Due to inadvertent group discussion of this \nrecommendation, this section with all three recommendations \nwas then moved to the Musculoskeletal Complications \nchapter, which was composed of different panelists, to avoid \nthe introduction of group interaction bias. The panelists \nwere informed of the full set of evidence, provided with the \nrelevant papers and extracted data, and voting on the updated \nrecommendation took place. During reviews for consistency \nand gaps, three additional recommendations (one from the \nTreatment of Specific Hemorrhages chapter and two from \nthe Inhibitors to Clotting Factor chapter) required additional \nrevisions or the addition of remarks. One recommendation \nwas inadvertently excluded from the original surveys for \nthe Prophylaxis in Hemophilia chapter. All were rectified \nthrough additional survey rounds.\n12.5\t\nFinalization of the \nrecommendations and manuscript \ndevelopment\nAt the conclusion of the final round of the modified Delphi \nsurveys, the chapter leads finalized the manuscripts for \ntheir assigned chapters. All recommendations that achieved \nconsensus were incorporated within the relevant section of the \nmanuscript, bolded, and numbered accordingly. All remarks \nare considered integral to the recommendations themselves \nand therefore included as part of the recommendations. The \nWFH advises that as recommendations are uploaded into \ndigital platforms, incorporated into separate lists, or otherwise \nremoved from this full guideline publication, the remarks \nshould always be kept with the rest of the recommendation \nas a single unit.\nThese guidelines have an intrinsic navigation system for \nthe chapters, sections, recommendations, and supplemental \nmaterials. The numbering system uses the chapter number \nas the initial number, followed by the section numbers. \nRecommendations are numbered according to the chapter \nand section in which they appear.

Final \nmanuscripts were reviewed by the chapter lead and panelists; \nthe content lead and co-lead; the GPTF; key members of the \nWFH senior management team; followed by an external \nteam of highly experienced healthcare professionals with \nexpertise in the care of people with hemophilia, and well-\ninformed expert people with hemophilia from around the \nworld, ensuring a global perspective. Finally, the entirety of \nthe guidelines was submitted to several organizations for \ntheir review and consideration for endorsement. Comments \nat each stage of review were considered by the chapter leads, \nand modifications were made when relevant. No editing or \nchanges to the recommendations or remarks were permitted. \nA final independent peer review was also done through \nthe Haemophilia journal and the extensive comments were \naddressed.\n12.6\t\nMethodology limitations\nAs is common in guideline development, methodological \nprocesses have to be pragmatically adjusted to accommodate \nchallenges with the available evidence, organizational matters, \nand other constraints. Similarly, with these guidelines, \ncompromises were required in order to provide the best \nguidance possible in a clinical area with limitations in the \nevidence base.\nThe panels were organized by invitation and without a \ndeclared review of conflicts of interest (although current \ndisclosures accompany this publication). All panelists were \ninvited to participate in the scope of the chapter searches, \nwhich was accepted as a proxy for a priori established PICO \n(Population/Intervention/Comparators/ Outcomes paradigm) \nquestions.\nSearch strategies were then developed by highly \nexperienced medical librarians based on the scope discussions \nand early drafts, although they were not peer-reviewed. Since \nthe last guidelines were published in 2012, the searches were \nrestricted to the years 2010-2019 for the chapters which are \nrevisions from the previous edition. However, since that \nedition did not include a formal systematic review, future \nsearches may have to be extended further back in time.\nStudies identified as retrospective by the screeners were \nexcluded, except where specified above. For a rare disease, \nespecially for the more subjective topics, a more comprehensive \nand reliable evidence base would have included these reviews.\nDue to the high yield of references from the searches \nfor the Prophylaxis in Hemophilia chapter, references were \nlimited to studies with a minimum sample size of 40. Sample \nsize is not a proxy for quality, but alternative options to limit \nthe number of studies to meet the timeframe did not exist.\nBoth single screening, rather than dual screening with \nadjudication, and single data extractions, rather than dual \nextractions with adjudication, were necessary compromises.\nThere were no critical appraisals of the quality of the \nevidence or assessments of the feasibility of quantitative \nanalyses as these had been ruled out in advance due to previous \nefforts to conduct systematic reviews in this rare disease.\nConsiderable support was provided to reduce the burden \non the volunteer panelists in the literature searches, screenings, \ndata extractions, and drafting of the manuscripts. Like all \nmulti-chapter guidelines, the level of consistency of writing \nvaried across chapters, but the medical editors strove to \nreduce duplication and ensure standardization. This helped to \nensure a final consistent format in these important guidelines \nfor all users.\n12.7\t\nFuture plans for updates\nWith this third edition, the WFH Guidelines for the \nManagement of Hemophilia have advanced considerably and \ncomply with current standards for guideline development using \nthe TCBS approach.3 As additional research is conducted in the \nfield of hemophilia, as methods standardize, and knowledge \ngrows, published data should become more homogeneous \nand quantifiable, permitting more evidence-based guideline \nupdates by the WFH in many of the content areas. This \nwill also increase the methodological rigor and allow the \nevolving science to guide future recommendations, especially \nin areas where the research is growing, such as diagnostic \nmethods, hemostatic agents, regular replacement strategies, \nand management of inhibitors apart from curative treatments. \nAdditional efforts will follow the advancing work of several \ninternational initiatives to provide recommendations for digital \nplatforms and repositories and to increase implementation, \nespecially at the point of care.\n12.8\t\nConclusion\nEven though this third edition of the WFH Guidelines for \nthe Management of Hemophilia is primarily intended for", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604163632", "file_path": "knowledge_base/hemophilia/WF Treatment Guidelines 3ed_ENG.pdf", "total_pages": 184, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604163632", "page": 173}}

Significant\nvariability exists in management options offered to patients.\nObjective: These evidence-based guidelines from the American Society of Hematology (ASH), the\nInternational Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), the National Hemophilia Foundation\n(NHF), and the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) are intended to support patients, clinicians, and\nhealth care professionals in their decisions about management of VWD.\nMethods: ASH, ISTH, NHF, and WFH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel. Three patient\nrepresentatives were included. The panel was balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest.\nThe University of Kansas Outcomes and Implementation Research Unit and the McMaster Grading of\nRecommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Centre supported the guideline\ndevelopment process, including performing and updating systematic evidence reviews (through November\n2019). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance to clinicians\nand patients. The panel used the GRADE approach, including GRADE Evidence-to-Decision frameworks,\nto assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.\nResults: The panel agreed on 12 recommendations and outlined future research priorities.\nConclusions: These guidelines make key recommendations regarding prophylaxis for frequent\nrecurrent bleeding, desmopressin trials to determine therapy, use of antiplatelet agents and\nanticoagulant therapy, target VWF and factor VIII activity levels for major surgery, strategies to\nreduce bleeding during minor surgery or invasive procedures, management options for heavy\nmenstrual bleeding, management of VWD in the context of neuraxial anesthesia during labor and\ndelivery, and management in the postpartum setting.\nSummary of recommendations\nThese guidelines are based on updated and original systematic reviews of evidence conducted under\nthe direction of the Outcomes and Implementation Research Unit at the University of Kansas Medical\nCenter (KUMC). The panel followed best practices for guideline development recommended by the\nInstitute of Medicine and the Guidelines International Network (G-I-N).1-3 The panel used the Grading\nof Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the\ncertainty in the evidence and formulate recommendations.4-10\nSubmitted 3 September 2020; accepted 27 October 2020; published online 12\nJanuary 2021.

Multiple subtypes exist and require individualized\ntreatment based on specific diagnosis, bleeding phenotype, and\nspecific clinical context.11 Major symptoms include mucocutaneous\nbleeding, including epistaxis, easy bruising, and heavy menstrual\nbleeding, as well as provoked bleeding in the setting of surgery and\nother invasive procedures. Major therapies include use of desmo-\npressin to induce endothelial release of stored von Willebrand\nfactor (VWF) and factor VIII (FVIII) and use of VWF concentrates,\nincluding both plasma-derived and recombinant products, as well\nas adjuvant therapies, such as antifibrinolytic tranexamic acid. Manage-\nment remains challenging because of wide variability in individual patient\nbleeding symptoms, wide variability in clinical practice, and lack of\nhigh-certainty evidence to guide decision making.\nInterpretation of strong and\nconditional recommendations\nThe strength of a recommendation is expressed as either strong\n(“the guideline panel recommends”) or conditional (“the guideline\npanel suggests”) and has the following interpretation:\nStrong recommendation\nc\nFor patients: most individuals in this situation would want the\nrecommended course of action, and only a small proportion\nwould not.\nc\nFor clinicians: most individuals should follow the recommended\ncourse of action. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed\nto help individual patients make decisions consistent with their\nvalues and preferences.\nc\nFor policy makers: the recommendation can be adopted as\npolicy in most situations. Adherence to this recommendation\naccording to the guidelines could be used as a quality criterion\nor performance indicator.\nc\nFor researchers: the recommendation is supported by credible\nresearch or other convincing judgments that make additional\nresearch unlikely to alter the recommendation. On occasion,\na strong recommendation is based on low or very low certainty in\nthe evidence. In such instances, further research may provide\nimportant information that alters the recommendation.\nConditional recommendation\nc\nFor patients: a majority of individuals in this situation would want\nthe suggested course of action, but many would not. Decision\naids may be useful in helping patients to make decisions\nconsistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences.\nc\nFor clinicians: different choices will be appropriate for individual\npatients, and clinicians must help each patient arrive at a manage-\nment decision consistent with their values and preferences.\nDecision aids may be useful in helping individuals to make decisions\nconsistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences.\nc\nFor policy makers: policy making will require substantial debate\nand involvement of various stakeholders. Performance measures\nabout the suggested course of action should focus on if an\nappropriate decision-making process is duly documented.\nc\nFor researchers: this recommendation is likely to be strength-\nened (for future updates or adaptation) by additional research.\nAn evaluation of the conditions and criteria (and the related\njudgments, research evidence, and additional considerations)\nthat determined the conditional (rather than strong) recommen-\ndation will help identify possible research gaps.\nInterpretation of good practice statements\nAs described by the GRADE Working Group, good practice\nstatements endorse interventions or practices that the guideline\npanel agreed have unequivocal net benefit yet may not be widely\nrecognized or used.12 Good practice statements in these guide-\nlines are not based on a systematic review of available evidence.\nNevertheless, they may be interpreted as strong recommendations.\nRecommendations\nProphylaxis.\nRECOMMENDATION 1.

The administration of desmopressin to\npatients with type 2B VWD is generally contraindicated, because\nthis may cause thrombocytopenia as a result of increased platelet\nbinding.\nFurthermore, desmopressin is generally contraindicated in patients\nwith active cardiovascular disease (eg, coronary heart disease,\ncerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease), patients\nwith seizure disorders, patients age ,2 years, and patients with\ntype 1C VWD in the setting of surgery. Desmopressin has been\nused safely in many women during pregnancy, including those with\nbleeding disorders and diabetes insipidus. It should be avoided in\nwomen with preeclampsia and those with cardiovascular disease.\nIV fluid infusion and oxytocic medications are often used during\nlabor and delivery, both of which increase the risk of desmopressin-\ninduced hyponatremia.\nPatients receiving desmopressin are at risk for hyponatremia from\nfree water retention; therefore, they should receive normal saline\nif IV fluid replacement is required, and oral free water fluid intake\nshould be restricted to prevent hyponatremia.\nPatient counseling about desmopressin should include strategies\nto mitigate risks associated with hyponatremia (eg, free water\nrestriction and education about signs and symptoms of hyponatremia\nthat should lead to prompt medical evaluation) and cardiovascular\ndisease.\nAntithrombotic therapy.\nRECOMMENDATION 3. In patients with\nVWD and cardiovascular disease who require treatment with\nantiplatelet agents or anticoagulant therapy, the panel suggests\ngiving the necessary antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy over no\ntreatment (conditional recommendation based on low certainty in\nthe evidence of effects ⊕⊕◯◯).\nRemark:\nc\nIt is important to reassess the bleeding risk throughout the\ncourse of treatment.\nGOOD\nPRACTICE\nSTATEMENTS. Patients considered for treatment\nrequire individualized analyses of the risks and benefits of the\nspecific therapy plan in conjunction with a multidisciplinary team\nthat includes cardiovascular medicine specialists, hematologists,\nand the patient.\nPatient education about the risks and benefits of using antiplatelet\nagents or anticoagulant therapy should be provided to inform\nshared decision making.\nPatients with a severe bleeding phenotype (eg, severe type 1, type\n2, or type 3 VWD) may require prophylaxis with VWF concentrate to\nprevent bleeding while on antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy;\nsimilar precautions may apply to patients with type 1 VWD and\nconcurrent additional bleeding problems.\nDesmopressin therapy is generally contraindicated in individuals\nwith cardiovascular disease (eg, coronary heart disease, cerebro-\nvascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease) and/or increased\nrisk of thrombosis.\nMajor surgery.\nRECOMMENDATION 4A. The panel suggests targeting\nboth FVIII and VWF activity levels of $0.50 IU/mL for at least 3 days\nafter surgery (conditional recommendation based on very low\ncertainty in the evidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯).\nRECOMMENDATION 4B.

The panel suggests using tranexamic acid\nover desmopressin to treat women with VWD and heavy menstrual\nbleeding who wish to conceive (conditional recommendation based\non very low certainty in the evidence ⊕◯◯◯).\nRemarks:\nc\nThis recommendation does not imply that the interventions\nconsidered can be prescribed only as monotherapy. In some\ncases, multiple options can be combined, especially if control\nof heavy menstrual bleeding is less than optimal with the initial\ntherapy.\nc\nDesmopressin is not effective in type 3 and many type 2 VWD\npatients and is contraindicated in type 2B VWD.\nc\nWomen may require additional treatment directed at bleeding\nsymptoms for the first several menstrual cycles after placement\nof a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system.\nGOOD PRACTICE STATEMENTS. When feasible, the panel encourages the\ndevelopment of multidisciplinary clinics in which gynecologists and\nhematologists see patients jointly to facilitate the management of\nheavy menstrual bleeding for patients with bleeding disorders.\nDecisions regarding the use of a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauter-\nine system should be made in the setting of shared decision making\nwith multidisciplinary input (eg, gynecology professionals, hematol-\nogy professionals, and patients).\nFor some patients, there may be other benefits with use of hormonal\ntherapy, such as treatment of menstrual pain and management of\nendometriosis- and polycystic ovary syndrome–related symptoms.\nBoth iron deficiency and anemia resulting from iron deficiency are\nassociated with adverse outcomes, including diminished health-\nrelated quality of life. Patients with heavy menstrual bleeding should\nbe regularly assessed and treated for iron deficiency and/or anemia.\nWomen with known bleeding disorders and heavy menstrual bleeding\nshould undergo a standard gynecologic assessment that is recom-\nmended for women with heavy menstrual bleeding in the general\npopulation to rule out common pelvic pathologies, such as fibroids\nand polyps, especially those not responding to first-line treatment.\nSpecial consideration is required in terms of adverse effects of therapy\nfor those who are at high risk of endometrial hyperplasia/malignancies,\nsuch as women age .35 years and those with polycystic ovaries,\nhigh body mass index, and comorbidities, such as diabetes and\nhypertension.\nObstetrics:\nneuraxial\nanesthesia.\nRECOMMENDATION\n7. In\nwomen with VWD for whom neuraxial anesthesia during labor is\ndeemed suitable, the panel suggests targeting a VWF activity level\nof 0.50 to 1.50 IU/mL over targeting an activity level of .1.50 IU/mL\nto allow neuraxial anesthesia (conditional recommendation based\non very low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯).\nRemarks:\nc\nNeuraxial anesthesia refers to spinal, epidural, or combined\nspinal-epidural procedures performed for surgical anesthesia\nfor operative deliveries or pain relief during labor.\nc\nThis recommendation focused on the outcomes of the anesthesia\nprocedure itself and not on the effects of the VWF levels on\npostpartum hemorrhage (PPH), in which VWF activity levels\nof .1.50 IU/mL may be advised in some situations.\nc\nIndividual risk assessment should be performed, taking into\naccount patient diagnosis and history, and for this reason, the\npanel advocates a third-trimester visit where VWF and FVIII\nactivity levels can be checked and a prospective plan formed for\nanesthesia and delivery.\nc\nThis recommendation is intended for women who desire or\nrequire neuraxial anesthesia and does not address suitability of\nneuraxial anesthesia itself.\nc\nVWF activity levels should be maintained at .0.50 IU/mL while\nthe epidural is in place and for at least 6 hours after removal.\nc\nThe assessment of whether neuraxial anesthesia is appro-\npriate for an individual patient is a complex decision that\nincludes assessment of factors outside the scope of these\nguidelines. The ultimate decision about whether it is appropri-\nate for an individual patient to undergo these procedures\nlies with the obstetric anesthesiologist or other clinician\nperforming the procedure. Decisions regarding anesthesia\nand delivery should be made in the context of a multidisci-\nplinary discussion with input from anesthesia, hematology,\nand obstetrics and shared decision making with the patient.\nThese discussions should take place well in advance of the\npatient’s due date.\nc\nPatients should also be assessed for thrombotic risk\npostdelivery, and prophylaxis (eg, compression stockings\nor low-molecular-weight heparin) should be provided when\nneeded.\nObstetrics:\npostpartum\nmanagement\nRECOMMENDATION\n8.\nThe guideline panel suggests the use of tranexamic acid over not\nusing it in women with type 1 VWD or low VWF levels (and this may\nalso apply to types 2 and 3 VWD) during the postpartum period)\n(conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence of\neffects ⊕⊕◯◯).\nGood practice statements.

The primary goals\nof these guidelines are to review, critically appraise, and imple-\nment evidence-based recommendations that will improve access to\nappropriate treatments and facilitate individualized therapy when\nappropriate. Through improved provider and patient education on\nthe available evidence and evidence-based recommendations,\nthese guidelines aim to provide clinical decision support for shared\ndecision making that will result in increased access to quality care\nfor patients with VWD.\nThe target audience includes patients, hematologists, general\npractitioners, internists, obstetricians, gynecologists, surgeons,\nanesthesiologists, maternal-fetal medicine experts, other clinicians,\nand decision makers. Policy makers who may be interested in these\nguidelines include those involved in developing local, national, or\ninternational plans with the goals of implementing effective care\nmanagement protocols and improving outcomes for patients with\nVWD. This document may also serve as the basis for adaptation by\nlocal, regional, or national guideline panels.\nDescription of the health problem\nVWD is the most common inherited bleeding disorder, originally\ndescribed by Erik von Willebrand in 1926.13 Current best estimates\nobtained from the primary care setting suggest that VWD affects 1\nin 1000 individuals.14 Despite this, many practitioners remain\nunaware of how to diagnose or treat affected patients. VWF plays\na key role in coagulation, because it serves as a carrier protein for\nFVIII15 and facilitates platelet binding to exposed collagen at sites of\ninjury.16 VWD occurs when there are either quantitative or qualitative\ndefects in VWF. Difficulties in diagnosis are compounded by the\nexistence of 3 major subtypes of VWD (Table 1).17\nDiagnostic thresholds and criteria for the diagnosis and classifica-\ntion of VWD are covered in the concurrent guideline, “ASH ISTH\nNHF WFH 2020 Guidelines on the Diagnosis of von Willebrand\nDisease.”18 Types 1 and 3 are quantitative defects, with type 1\nVWD representing a mild to moderate deficiency in the VWF\nprotein and type 3 VWD representing the more severe form, with\nnear-complete absence of VWF. The recently described type 1C\nsubtype of VWD is characterized by a shortened VWF half-life,\nwhich requires potential management changes as compared with\ntype 1 VWD.19 Type 2 VWD includes variants with a qualitative\ndefect in 1 of VWF’s main functions, either forming of multimers\n(types 2A and 2B), platelet binding (type 2M), or FVIII binding (type\n2N). The mechanism of type 2B VWD is important, because it\nrepresents a gain-of-function defect, with increased platelet binding\nleading to clearance of both VWF and platelets.20\nThe major symptoms of VWD include mucocutaneous bleeding,\nsuch as epistaxis, easy bruising, prolonged bleeding from minor\ncuts, and heavy menstrual bleeding, as well as surgical bleeding,\nparticularly in the setting of dental extractions. Patients with type 3\nVWD may experience joint bleeds similar to those seen in\nhemophilia.21 Heavy menstrual bleeding is of particular concern in\nwomen because of its monthly occurrence, affecting their quality of\nlife as well as their overall health.22,23 Many women experience iron\ndeficiency and anemia resulting from the presence of unrecognized\nor inadequately treated heavy menstrual bleeding.24 Complications\nresulting from PPH are also more frequent in women with VWD.25,26\nAppropriate treatment is a major challenge for affected patients.\nExisting guidelines have focused on expert opinion, with little room\nfor patient preference or critical examination of the evidence for\nspecific recommendations, resulting in the potential for increased\ncosts to patients and families, ineffective therapies, or lack of\nconsideration of effective therapies.\nThe scope of this guideline has been informed by areas of concern\nfor patients and providers alike, which include treatment options for\nwomen with VWD, treatment options for surgery, testing during\ninvasive procedures, use of desmopressin, and prophylaxis as\nhighlighted by an international survey on VWD spearheaded by\npartner organizations.27 These considerations informed the panel’s\ndeliberations, with a high value placed on patients’ desire for\nappropriate treatment and providers’ desire to provide the highest\nquality of care.\nMethods\nThe guideline panel developed and graded the recommendations\nand assessed the certainty in the supporting evidence following the\nGRADE approach.4-10 The overall guideline development process,\nincluding funding of the work, panel formation, management of\nconflicts of interest, internal and external reviews, and organizational\napproval, was guided by policies and procedures derived from\nthe G-I-N-McMaster Guideline Development Checklist28 and was\nintended to meet recommendations for trustworthy guidelines by\nthe Institute of Medicine and the GIN.1-3,29\nOrganization, panel composition, planning,\nand coordination\nThese guidelines were developed as a collaboration by the\nAmerican Society of Hematology (ASH), the International Society\nof Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), the National Hemophilia\nFoundation (NHF), and the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH).\nThe work of the panel was coordinated by ASH and the Outcomes\nand Implementation Research Unit at KUMC (funded by the\ncollaborating organizations, under a paid agreement).

To ensure that recent studies were not missed,\nsearches in Medline (via OVID) and EMBASE (presented in\nsupplemental Data 4) first conducted in December 2018 were\nupdated in November 2019, and panel members were asked to\nsuggest any studies that may have been considered missed and\nfulfilled the inclusion criteria for the individual questions.\nUnder the direction of the Outcomes and Implementation Research\nUnit at KUMC and the McMaster GRADE Centre, researchers\nfollowed the general methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook\nfor Systematic Reviews of Interventions for conducting new systematic\nreviews of intervention effects. Risk of bias was assessed at the health\noutcome level using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 1.0 tool for randomized\ntrials and the Risk of Bias Assessment of Non-Randomized Studies\nof Interventions for nonrandomized studies. When there was no\nevidence from randomized trials or comparative observational\nstudies, we conducted systematic reviews of case series. In\naddition to conducting systematic reviews of intervention effects,\nthe researchers searched for evidence related to baseline risks,\nvalues, preferences, and costs and summarized findings within the\nEtD framework.4,5,10 Subsequently, the certainty in the body of evidence\n(also known as quality of the evidence or confidence in the estimated\neffects) was assessed for each effect estimate of the outcomes of\ninterest following the GRADE approach based on the following domains:\nrisk of bias, precision, consistency, directness of the evidence,\nrisk of publication bias, presence of large effects, dose-response\nrelationship, and assessment of the effect of residual, opposing\nconfounding. The certainty was categorized into 4 levels: very low\n(⊕◯◯◯), low (⊕⊕◯◯), moderate (⊕⊕⊕◯), and high (⊕⊕⊕⊕).6-8\nDuring a 2-day in-person meeting, the panel developed clinical\nrecommendations based on the evidence summarized in the EtD\ntables. For each recommendation, the panel took a population\nperspective and came to consensus on the following: the certainty\nin the evidence, the balance of benefits and harms of the compared\nmanagement options, and the assumptions about the values and\npreferences associated with the decision. The guideline panel also\nexplicitly considered the extent of resource use associated with\nalternative management options. The panel agreed on the recommen-\ndations (including direction and strength), remarks, and qualifications by\nconsensus or, in rare instances, by voting (an 80% majority was required\nfor a strong recommendation) based on the balance of all desirable and\nundesirable consequences. The final guidelines, including recommen-\ndations, were reviewed and approved by all members of the panel.\nInterpretation of strong and\nconditional recommendations\nThe recommendations are labeled as either “strong” or “conditional”\naccording to the GRADE approach. The words “the guideline panel\nrecommends” are used for strong recommendations and “the guideline\npanel suggests” for conditional recommendations. Table 3 provides the\nGRADE interpretation of strong and conditional recommendations by\npatients, clinicians, health care policy makers, and researchers.\nDocument review\nDraft recommendations were reviewed by all members of the panel,\nrevised, and then made available online on 6 April 2020 for external\nreview by stakeholders, including allied organizations, other\nmedical professionals, patients, and the public; 49 individuals\nsubmitted comments. The document was revised to address\npertinent comments, but no changes were made to recommendations.\nThe ASH Guideline Oversight Subcommittee on 18 August 2020\nand the ASH Committee on Quality on 26 August 2020 approved that\nthe defined guideline development process was followed, and on\n28 August 2020, the officers of the ASH Executive Committee\napproved submission of the guidelines for publication under the\nimprimatur of ASH. On 28 August 2020, ISTH approved that the\ndefined guideline development process was followed; on 27 August\n2020, NHF approved that the defined guideline development process\nwas followed; and on 25 August 2020, WFH approved that the defined\nguideline development process was followed.

For the purpose of this question, major\nbleeding was defined as bleeding requiring hospital admission,\nrequiring surgical intervention, requiring blood transfusion (of at\nleast 2 units), resulting in a drop of $2 g/dL in hemoglobin, or\nresulting in symptoms involving critical areas (intracranial, intraspinal,\nintraocular, retroperitoneal, intraarticular, pericardial, or intramuscular\nwith compartment syndrome). Prophylaxis was defined as a period\nof at least 6 months of treatment consisting of VWF replace-\nment administered at least once weekly. In the single randomized\ncontrolled trial evaluating prophylaxis, frequent bleeds were defined\nas “$5 bleeding episodes in the last 12 months, or $3 episodes of\nhaemarthrosis at the same joint or $2 episodes of gastrointestinal\nhaemorrhage either unexplained or in association with underlying\ngastrointestinal angiodysplasia with requirement of [VWF concentrate]\ntherapy.”34(p392)\nThe EtD framework for this recommendation is available online at\nhttps://guidelines.ash.gradepro.org/profile/JLMHIOqdI3E.\nBenefits, harms, and burden.\nIn the single available randomized\ncontrolled trial (n 5 19), routine VWF concentrate prophylaxis in patients\nwith severe VWD reduced the risk of bleeding episodes (rate ratio [RR],\n0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17-0.35), improved the time to first\nbleeding event (mean difference, 31.4 days longer; 95% CI, 8.44-54.36\ndays), and reduced epistaxis (RR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.21-0.67).34 Pro-\nphylaxis also probably reduced the number of spontaneous\nbleeds (RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.37-1.04) and hemarthrosis (RR, 0.50;\n95% CI, 0.06-4.50), although this did not reach statistical significance.\nIn the randomized controlled trial, prophylaxis seemed to result in\nmore bleeding episodes lasting .2 days (RR, 45.69; 95% CI,\n11.09-188.21) and more gastrointestinal hemorrhage (RR, 13.87;\n95% CI, 1.84-104.46)34; however, the guideline panel noted that\na majority of these events occurred in a single patient, possibly\nleading to overestimation of harm. Other forms of major bleeding,\njoint function, mortality, heavy menstrual bleeding, health-related\nquality of life, need for transfusions, and absence (from school,\nwork, or other required activities) were not reported.\nIn observational studies with explicit comparative data,35-43,52 VWF\nconcentrate prophylaxis reduced the risk of bleeding episodes\n(RR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.25-0.46), hospitalizations (RR, 0.64; 95% CI,\n0.44-0.93), and heavy menstrual bleeding (median change in episodes,\n29; interquartile range [IQR], 29.3 to 26.0).

{"doc_id": "0934d333-8ae7-49bf-92b3-97dce0d17fa5", "content": "Other EtD criteria and considerations.\nIn a survey of\nguideline panel members, all panelists suggested that patients are\nlikely to place high value on reducing the risk of bleeding and that\nthe consequences of bleeding for quality of life may play a role in\ndecision making. The frequency and severity of the bleeding events,\nage of patient, and input from family members and other caregivers\nwill affect decision making by an individual patient. Patients with\na higher rate of bleeding are more likely to place a higher value\non preventing such bleeding episodes than on avoiding adverse\nevents, whereas those without a significant bleeding history place\na lower value on prophylaxis. Most panel members highlighted\nthe importance of discussing the risks and benefits of the various\ntreatment strategies with the patient. Based on this, the panel\njudged that there is possibly important uncertainty or variability\nin patients’ values and preferences. The panel highlighted the\nimportance of educational materials for patients who are candidates\nfor prophylaxis to help them understand the potential benefits and\nharms of this treatment strategy. Prophylaxis is associated with high\ncosts because of the expense of VWF concentrate. Additionally,\nthere is a lack of cost-effectiveness studies to assess the overall net\nhealth benefit. The panel agreed that prophylaxis was probably\nacceptable to most individuals, especially in the setting of limited\naccess to emergency/acute care facilities for treatment of acute\nbleeding episodes. For some events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding,\nmore intensive therapy may be required.53 Lack of large numbers of\nwomen in the cited studies raised questions about the applicabil-\nity of prophylaxis for heavy menstrual bleeding, but no inherent\ndifferences between men and women were observed for other\ntypes of bleeds. Specific recommendations for heavy menstrual\nbleeding are discussed in “Gynecology: heavy menstrual\nbleeding.” Applicability will also vary in pediatric populations\nbecause of challenges with venous access and tolerability of\ninjections.\nAnother important consideration is the use of prophylaxis to prevent\njoint bleeds and joint damage. Primary prophylaxis is commonly\nperformed in severe hemophilia patients, but this is less common\nin VWD, although patients with severe VWD can still experience\nsignificant joint damage,54 which may affect quality of life, because\nphysical activity may be limited as a result of bleeding or fear of\nbleeding.55\nConclusions and research needs for this recommendation.\nThe guideline panel determined that there is low-certainty evidence\nfor a net health benefit of using long-term prophylaxis in patients\nwith VWD and a history of severe and frequent bleeds. Based on\nthe body of available evidence, it is likely that long-term prophylaxis\nreduces the risk of developing recurrent bleeding episodes,\nsuch as epistaxis and possibly also the development of spontane-\nous bleeding and hemarthrosis. There is very low certainty that\nlong-term prophylaxis has an effect on other outcomes. However,\nbecause of low certainty in the evidence or no published information\nabout other outcomes, the fact that we did not find evidence of an\neffect on these outcomes does not imply that such an effect does\nnot exist. The high costs were considered to be worth this net\nbenefit by both clinicians and patients on the panel. Long-term\nprophylaxis is likely to be acceptable and feasible to implement,\nand this recommendation is likely to increase equity. Therefore,\nthe desirable consequences are greater than the undesirable con-\nsequences. VWF concentrate administration is outlined in Table 4.\nThe panel identified the following additional research needs:\n(1) large randomized controlled trials on the use of prophylaxis\nversus on-demand therapy, particularly in patients with mucosal\nbleeds; (2) studies on the use of prophylaxis for heavy menstrual\nbleeding; (3) studies on the use of prophylaxis in gastrointestinal\nbleeding; (4) studies on the impact of prophylaxis on quality of\nlife; (5) studies on the use of plasma-derived vs recombinant VWF\nconcentrate for prophylaxis; (6) the role of concurrent antifibrinolytic\ntherapy with prophylaxis for mucosal bleeding (eg, epistaxis,\nheavy menstrual bleeding, and gastrointestinal bleeding); and\n(7) the role of concurrent antiangiogenic therapies with prophylaxis\nfor gastrointestinal bleeding.\nDesmopressin challenge/trial and administration\nIn patients with VWD, should health care providers perform\na desmopressin challenge and choose a treatment of bleeding\ndepending on its results, not perform the desmopressin challenge\nand treat with VWF concentrate and/or tranexamic acid, or not\nperform the desmopressin challenge and treat with desmopressin\nempirically?\nRecommendation 2a\nIn patients for whom desmopressin is a valid treatment option\n(primarily type 1 VWD) and who have a baseline VWF level\nof ,0.30 IU/mL, the panel suggests performing a trial of des-\nmopressin and treating based on the results over not performing\na trial and treating with tranexamic acid or factor concentrate\n(conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the\nevidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯).\nRecommendation 2b\nIn these patients, the panel suggests against treating with\ndesmopressin in the absence of desmopressin trial results\n(conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the\nevidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯).\nTable 4.

Desmopressin is\ncontraindicated in type 3 VWD because of a lack of\nefficacy and in type 2B VWD because of increased\nplatelet binding with subsequent thrombocytopenia.\nc\nMany patients with type 2 VWD do not respond to\ndesmopressin and require other modes of treatment.\nHowever, a desmopressin trial may be helpful to confirm\ndiagnosis, and desmopressin may still be useful in some\ninstances of mild bleeding in type 2 VWD patients.\nc\nPatients undergoing major surgery, including in sites where\neven a small amount of bleeding may result in critical organ\ndamage (eg, central nervous system surgery), should not\nreceive desmopressin as sole therapy.\nc\nIt is optimal to confirm desmopressin responsiveness\nbefore using desmopressin for therapeutic interventions,\nbut because this may not always be practical, adult\npatients with type 1 VWD whose baseline VWF levels\nare $0.30 IU/mL can be presumed to be desmopressin\nresponsive. Although they can receive desmopressin\nwithout requiring a trial, it is reasonable to obtain VWF\nlevels to confirm the response after administration. Patients\nwith type 1 VWD and VWF levels of ,0.30 IU/mL may not\nrespond to desmopressin, hence the recommendation\nfor a trial.\nc\nThis recommendation does not address the choice between\ntreating with tranexamic acid and VWF concentrate.\nGood practice statements: The administration of desmopressin\nto patients with type 2B VWD is generally contraindicated,\nbecause this may cause thrombocytopenia as a result of increased\nplatelet binding.56 Furthermore, desmopressin is generally contra-\nindicated in patients with active cardiovascular disease (eg, coronary\nheart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular\ndisease), patients with seizure disorders, patients age ,2 years,\nand patients with type 1C VWD in the setting of surgery.\nDesmopressin has been used safely in many women during\npregnancy, including those with bleeding disorders and diabetes\ninsipidus. It should be avoided in women with preeclampsia and\nthose with cardiovascular disease. IV fluid infusion and oxytocic\nmedications are often used during labor and delivery, both of which\nincrease the risk of desmopressin-induced hyponatremia.57-59\nPatients receiving desmopressin are at risk for hyponatremia from\nfree water retention; therefore, they should receive normal saline\nif IV fluid replacement is required, and oral free water fluid intake\nshould be restricted to prevent hyponatremia.\nPatient counseling about desmopressin should include strate-\ngies to mitigate risks associated with hyponatremia (eg, free\nwater restriction and education about signs and symptoms of\nhyponatremia that should lead to prompt medical evaluation) and\ncardiovascular disease.\nSummary of the evidence.\nWe did not find any comparative\nstudies directly addressing the question.

In terms of efficacy for management of heavy\nmenstrual bleeding, 1 study reported that 77% of 22 patients\nresponded to the treatment, as measured by a pictorial blood loss\nassessment chart (PBAC) score of ,100. Another study reported\nefficacy in 92% of patients with heavy menstrual bleeding for\na single dose (excellent efficacy) or 2 doses (good efficacy) of\ndesmopressin.77\nOverall, the certainty in these estimated effects is very low,\nbecause of risk of bias in the studies (none of the studies included\na control group to make inferences), lack of direct comparison,\nand imprecision of the estimates (evidence profile provided in\nsupplemental Data 5).\nHarms and burden.\nWith a strategy of performing a desmo-\npressin challenge and using the results to determine therapy for\nsurgical prophylaxis, the proportion of surgical events in which patients\nexperienced postoperative bleeding was 6% (95% CI, 0.02-0.14)\nacross 199 surgical events.61,62,64,67 One study reported that 10\nof 41 patients experienced emesis, of whom 5 required hospital\nadmission, and 1 patient developed hyponatremia.67 In another\nstudy, which involved 37 children, all developed some degree of\nhyponatremia, which was usually mild, but 2 experienced severe\nhyponatremia and 1 of these patients developed seizures.62\nWith a strategy of forgoing a desmopressin trial and treating\nempirically with VWF concentrate or tranexamic acid for surgical\nprophylaxis, the pooled risk of bleeding episodes was 9% across\n247 procedures (95% CI, 2%-34%).70,71-73 Adverse events related to\ntreatment were reported in 2% of 205 surgical procedures (95% CI,\n0%-31%); none was deemed serious.38,45,69,70 The need for\ntransfusion was 11% across 55 surgeries (95% CI, 5%-22%).45,70 In\npatients receiving tranexamic acid, headaches (60%), back pain\n(30%), and musculoskeletal pain (40%) were reported. Excessive\npostpartum bleeding occurred in 1 (6%) of 17 deliveries.\nFor the strategy of forgoing a desmopressin trial and treating\nempirically with desmopressin for surgical prophylaxis, hypona-\ntremia was noted in 4% to 72% of patients, although the\ndefinition of hyponatremia varied across the 3 studies.75,78,79\nEmpiric desmopressin therapy resulted in either headache (9%),\nfacial flushing (9%), or both (4.5%). When desmopressin was used\nfor surgical prophylaxis or treatment of acute bleeding, mild to\nmoderate adverse events, such as headache, flushing, nausea,\ndizziness, asthenia, vomiting, and peripheral edema, were reported\nin 43% of patients with mild type 1 VWD and 14% of those with\nmoderate type 1 VWD.77\nThere is very low certainty in the estimate of the risk of adverse\neffects because of lack of comparative studies, inconsistency of\nresults, and small sample sizes. The guideline panel judged that\nthe undesirable effects either of conducting a desmopressin trial\nwith treatment based on results or of forgoing a desmopressin\ntrial and treating with VWF concentrate or tranexamic acid are\nsmall but still important. The panel judged the undesirable effects\nof empiric use of desmopressin without a pretreatment trial to\nconfirm response as moderate in comparison. The guideline\npanel was specifically concerned about the possibility of expect-\ning an effect of therapy when actual response to that therapy is\nunknown and that of worsened thrombocytopenia in patients with\ntype 2B VWD receiving desmopressin.\nOther EtD criteria and considerations.\nThe panel agreed\nthere was possibly important uncertainty or variability in patient\nvalues, because there are patients who place a high value on the\npotential benefits of the desmopressin trial, whereas others place\na high value on avoiding the adverse effects of desmopressin.\nAccording to judgments made by the panel, the approach of\ncarrying out a desmopressin challenge and treating based on the\nresults and that of forgoing a desmopressin challenge and\ntreating with VWF concentrate or tranexamic acid are likely to be\nmore effective and less harmful than empiric use of desmopres-\nsin with uncertain efficacy in an individual patient.

We conducted a systematic review of\ncase series of patients with VWD who received antiplatelet agents or\nanticoagulant therapy. We found 2 case series reported in 3\nsources.82-84 The guideline panel was surveyed to systematically collect\npanel members’ experience in dealing with this issue. In addition, the\npanel discussed a case series of 19 patients with VWD who experienced\nan arterial thrombotic event and were treated with antiplatelet agents or\nanticoagulant therapy. This case series was not included in the original\nsystematic review, because it did not meet inclusion criteria, but the panel\nconsidered that it provided important context for the discussion.85 The\nEtD framework for this recommendation is available online at https://\nguidelines.ash.gradepro.org/profile/DZVC2VsFcdI.\nBenefits, harms, and burden.\nBecause no studies directly\ncompared treatment with antiplatelet agents or anticoagulant therapy\nvs no treatment, risk estimates for benefits are not available. In an\n8-patient case series, 1 patient with hemophilia died after experiencing\nintracranial posttraumatic bleeding while on aspirin; however, this\nwas after 11 years on therapy. Across 2 observational studies, none\nof 6 patients receiving low-molecular-weight heparin or warfarin\nexperienced thromboembolic events.83,84 In the 26 patients with\nVWD in the series, there was 1 major bleeding event. Serious\nadverse events, hospitalization, transfusion, health-related quality of\nlife, and heavy menstrual bleeding were not reported. The desirable\neffects of anticoagulation in the setting of cardiovascular disease were\njudged to be large, whereas the undesirable effects were judged to be\nmoderate, with variability in the latter resulting from type of anticoagulant\nand individual bleeding phenotype. Guideline panelists collectively\nreported their experience managing 65 patients with VWD who were\nrecommended to receive antiplatelet agents or anticoagulant therapy\nfor cardiovascular disease. In the 56 patients who received this therapy\nand in the 9 patients who did not receive therapy even though it was\nrecommended, the median mortality, thrombotic events, serious adverse\nevents, hospitalizations, and bleeding were low in both arms, and most\npatients were reported by their clinicians to have an acceptable health-\nrelated quality of life. Overall, the quality of the evidence for desirable\nand undesirable effects was judged to be very low because of serious\nrisk of bias in case series (lack of a control group), small number of\npatients and events (imprecision), and lack of direct comparisons.\nOther EtD criteria and considerations.\nPanel members\nemphasized the need for shared decision making with patients\nconsidering antiplatelet agents or anticoagulant therapy, and there\nwas a perception among panel members that there is likely to be\nimportant variability among patients regarding how they perceive\nthe tradeoff of risks and benefits of these therapies as well as\nvariation in underlying bleeding risk. Strict adherence to optimal\npostoperative care is important to minimize bleeding risk.

Subcutaneous administration has also been used.\nDose\nIV desmopressin is given as 0.3 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 20 mg. The desmopressin nasal spray (150 mg per spray) is given as 1 spray for\nindividuals weighing ,50 kg and 2 sprays for individuals weighing $50 kg.\nTiming of laboratory testing\nVWF antigen, VWF activity, and FVIII activity levels should be determined immediately before administration of desmopressin, ;30-60 min after\nadministration of desmopressin, and ;4 h postadministration, because in type 1C VWD, there is a rapid decrease in VWF levels.\nResponsiveness\nThere are multiple definitions of desmopressin responsiveness.128-130 The panel considered that an increase of at least 2 times the baseline VWF level\nand the ability to achieve both VWF and FVIII levels of .0.50 IU/mL were required to consider the patient responsive to desmopressin. Desmopressin\nresponsiveness does not guarantee, however, that the level achieved is adequate to prevent bleeding in all procedures (eg, higher levels may be\nindicated based on type of procedure).\nPrecautions\nBecause of the risk of hyponatremia, desmopressin should not be given on .3 concurrent days and is generally not administered to children age ,2 y.

Prophylaxis with VWF concentrate or\naddition of tranexamic acid may be required in patients with a severe\nbleeding phenotype to minimize bleeding.\nThe panel identified the following research priorities: (1) studies\non the use of prophylaxis in VWD patients receiving antiplatelet\nagents or anticoagulant therapy; (2) studies on the incidence of\ncardiovascular disease in patients with VWD; and (3) in the setting\nof coronary artery stent placement, studies on the risks and benefits\nof a bare metal stent with a shorter course of antiplatelet therapy vs\na drug-eluting stent and a longer course of antiplatelet therapy.\nMajor surgery\nIn patients with VWD undergoing major surgery, should the FVIII\nlevel be kept at $0.50 IU/mL for at least 3 days after surgery, or\nshould the VWF activity level be kept at $0.50 IU/mL for at least\n3 days after surgery?\nRecommendation 4a\nThe panel suggests targeting both FVIII and VWF activity levels\nof $0.50 IU/mL for at least 3 days after surgery (conditional\nrecommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of\neffects ⊕◯◯◯).\nRecommendation 4b\nThe panel suggests against using only FVIII $0.50 IU/mL as\na target level for at least 3 days after surgery (conditional rec-\nommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of\neffects ⊕◯◯◯).\nRemarks:\nc\nWhen it is possible to keep both trough levels at $0.50 IU/mL\nfor at least 3 days or as long as clinically indicated after\nthe surgery (instead of choosing only 1), this should be\nthe preferred option.\nc\nThe specific target levels should be individualized based\non the patient, type of procedure, and bleeding history\nas well as availability of VWF and FVIII testing.\nc\nThe duration of the intervention can vary for specific\ntypes of surgeries.\nSummary of the evidence.\nWe did not find any comparative\nstudies addressing this question, so we conducted a targeted\nsearch for case series in which patients with VWD underwent\nmajor surgery, with researchers reporting both FVIII and VWF\nactivity levels on postoperative day $3. The evidence synthesis\ncontained 7 case series reporting data for patients with a variety of\nVWD types/subtypes and various procedures, including total hip\nand knee arthroplasty and vascular, obstetric/gynecologic, abdom-\ninal, and minor dental procedures.37,45,46,86-89 The EtD framework\nfor this recommendation is available online at https://guidelines.ash.\ngradepro.org/profile/uhLux9nrMLM.\nBenefits, harms, and burden.\nBecause of the heterogeneity in\nreporting, we could not conduct metaanalyses. One series reported\na mean FVIII activity level of 1.344 IU/mL and a mean VWF activity of\n0.924 IU/mL, for which hemostatic efficacy was excellent in 92%,\ngood in 4%, and poor in 4%.46 There were no postoperative bleeding\ncomplications, adverse events related to therapy, or thrombotic events.\nAnother series reported a median FVIII level of 1.15 IU/mL (IQR, 0.97-\n1.34 IU/mL) and a median VWF level of 0.85 IU/mL (IQR, 0.67-1.03 IU/\nmL), with hemostatic efficacy in 100% and without any thrombotic\nevents.45 No other studies reported significant adverse events.\nBased on the limited available evidence, the panel could not make\na judgment regarding the magnitude of the desirable or undesirable\nanticipated effects of maintaining a FVIII activity level of $0.50 IU/mL\nfor at least 3 days after major surgery compared with maintaining\na VWF activity level of $0.50 IU/mL for at least 3 days after major\nsurgery.

Even though maintaining only FVIII\nat $0.50 IU/mL is likely to be more feasible to implement, there are\nseveral threats to feasibility and acceptability that make it unlikely that\nclinicians would choose only 1 of the options. Although maintaining\nonly the FVIII level .0.50 IU/mL for at least 3 days after surgery may\nbe logistically easier, especially in centers with long VWF activity\nlevel assay turnaround times or limited access to VWF concentrate\ncompared with FVIII preparations, administering only FVIII concen-\ntrate will not result in a sufficient increase in FVIII (because VWF\nserves as the carrier protein for FVIII) and will not address the underlying\nVWF defect. Maintaining VWF activity levels at $0.50 IU/mL allows\nVWF to participate in multiple physiologic roles in hemostasis and in most\ncases will simultaneously maintain FVIII activity levels at $0.50 IU/mL\nduring the critical time in the perioperative setting. Patients with specific\nsubtypes of VWD, such as type 2 and type 3, may not achieve adequate\nhemostasis if only FVIII levels are maintained after surgery. Therefore, the\npanel suggests keeping both the VWF activity level and FVIII activity level\n$0.50 IU/mL for at least 3 days in patients undergoing major surgery. It\nshould also be noted that local measures during surgery may be helpful,\nincluding use of hemostatic gelatin sponges, fibrin glue, and/or local\ntranexamic acid application.90 Some institutions have limited testing\ncapacity, with no availability of real-time FVIII or VWF monitoring. In\nsuch cases, patient safety should be considered, and elective high-\nrisk procedures may require alternate arrangements, such as\nmoving the procedure to a different facility. Alternatively, a pharma-\ncokinetic study using the planned preoperative dose can be\nperformed in advance to determine the optimal dose at the time\nof the surgery.91\nThe panel identified the following additional research need:\na randomized clinical trial to determine whether maintaining either\nthe FVIII or VWF activity level at .0.50 IU/mL for at least 3 days\nafter surgery leads to different outcomes, with particular attention to\nand stratification by type of procedure and associated bleeding risk.\nFurthermore, standardized definitions of major vs minor surgery and\noutcomes (eg, major and minor bleeding) as they apply to VWD\npatients will be critical to future research studies.\nMinor surgery/invasive procedures\nIn patients with VWD undergoing minor surgery or minor invasive\nprocedures, should the VWF level be increased to $0.50 IU/mL\n(with use of either VWF concentrate or desmopressin), should\ntranexamic acid monotherapy be used, or should combination\ntherapy by increasing the VWF level to $0.50 IU/mL (with use\nof either VWF concentrate or desmopressin) in conjunction with\ntranexamic acid be used?\nRecommendation 5a\nIn patients undergoing minor surgery or minor invasive pro-\ncedures, the panel suggests increasing VWF activity levels\nto $0.50 IU/mL with desmopressin or factor concentrate\nwith the addition of tranexamic acid over raising VWF levels\nto $0.50 IU/mL with desmopressin or factor concentrate\nalone (conditional recommendation based on very low cer-\ntainty in the evidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯).\nRecommendation 5b\nThe panel suggests giving tranexamic acid alone over increasing\nVWF activity levels to $0.50 IU/mL with any intervention in\npatients with type 1 VWD with baseline VWF activity levels of\n.0.30 IU/mL and a mild bleeding phenotype undergoing minor\nmucosal procedures (conditional recommendation based on\nvery low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯).\nRemarks:\nc\nIndividualized therapy plans should consider the variation\nin bleeding risk for the specific procedure in question.\nIndividualized therapy plans are especially important for\npatients who may be overtreated when VWF activity is\nincreased to $0.50 IU/mL by any therapy and addition\nof tranexamic acid (eg, those undergoing cutaneous\nprocedures, such as superficial skin biopsy).\nc\nPatients with type 3 VWD will require VWF concentrate\nto achieve any significant increase in VWF activity levels.\nUse of desmopressin is contraindicated in this popula-\ntion because of lack of efficacy.\nc\nMany patients with type 2 VWD (including patients with\ntype 2B VWD) will also require treatment with VWF\nconcentrate rather than desmopressin.\nc\nFor patients at higher risk of thrombosis, it may be\ndesirable to avoid the combination of extended increased\nVWF and FVIII levels (.1.50 IU/mL) and extended use of\ntranexamic acid.\nc\nDental proceduralists may consider use of local hemostatic\nmeasures (eg, gelatin sponges or fibrin glue, tranexamic", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/vWD/advancesadv2020003264c.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604164918", "file_path": "knowledge_base/vWD/advancesadv2020003264c.pdf", "total_pages": 25, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604164918", "page": 14}}

The\npatients on the guideline panel placed a high value on avoiding\nadverse effects, whereas clinicians placed a high value on avoiding\nbleeding complications. Based on the likelihood of desirable effects\non hemostasis and the potential for adverse effects, the panel\nranked 2 interventions (increasing VWF level to at least 0.50 IU/mL\nwith any intervention and tranexamic acid and increasing the VWF\nlevel to 0.50 IU/mL with any intervention) as having the best balance\nof effects.\nWhen making the judgment of which treatment strategy would be\nmost effective, the panel specifically considered patients with\nsevere bleeding phenotypes. However, the panel noted that not\nall patients require an increase in VWF level to 0.50 IU/mL in\nconjunction with tranexamic acid to have good outcomes. The panel\nagreed that tranexamic acid has the least harmful undesirable\neffects in comparison with therapies used to increase VWF levels,\nwhich have the potential to induce inhibitor formation or hypersen-\nsitivity reactions during infusion.\nThe panel also discussed the possibility that when 2 interventions\nare prescribed, there may be an additive effect with regard to\nadverse effects. This led the panel to judge increasing the VWF\nlevel to 0.50 IU/mL with any intervention in conjunction with\ntranexamic acid as most harmful. However, the panel noted that\nnone of the 3 treatment options are likely to result in frequent and\nimportant harms.\nAlthough tranexamic acid was the primary antifibrinolytic consid-\nered by the panel, we recognize that e aminocaproic acid is\na reasonable alternative, particularly when used as an oral rinse in\ndental procedures or as a liquid administration in the pediatric\npopulation.\nConclusions and research needs for these recommendations.\nBased on the body of available evidence, it is likely that tranexamic\nacid combined with achieving VWF levels of at least 0.50 IU/mL\nwith desmopressin or factor concentrate reduces the risk of\npostoperative bleeding. There is very low certainty that there is an\neffect of this strategy on major bleeding or adverse effects related\nto treatment. However, because of low certainty in the evidence or\nno published information about other outcomes, the fact that we\ndid not find evidence of an effect on these outcomes does not\nimply that such an effect does not exist.\nThe evidence suggests that achieving VWF levels of at least\n0.50 IU/mL by any therapy in conjunction with tranexamic acid\nwould provide the most desirable effects with regard to hemostasis.\nGiven that they have similar balances of effects, the recommenda-\ntion for increasing VWF levels to .0.50 IU/mL with desmopressin\nor factor concentrate with the addition of tranexamic acid over\nraising VWF levels to .0.50 IU/mL with desmopressin or factor\nconcentrate alone places a high value on the synergistic effects of\nboth VWF concentrate and tranexamic acid together, given the\ndifferent mechanisms of action as well as the minimal adverse effect\nprofile of tranexamic acid.\nThe recommendation for giving tranexamic acid alone vs increasing\nVWF levels to .0.50 IU/mL with any intervention in patients with\ntype 1 VWD with levels of .0.30 IU/mL and a mild bleeding\nphenotype undergoing a minor mucosal procedure places a high\nvalue on the small amount of resources required, the feasibility of\nprescribing tranexamic acid in a scenario in which the likelihood of", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/vWD/advancesadv2020003264c.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604164918", "file_path": "knowledge_base/vWD/advancesadv2020003264c.pdf", "total_pages": 25, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604164918", "page": 15}}

A\ncomparison of tranexamic acid and desmopressin showed that\nthe mean difference in menstrual blood loss as measured by\nPBAC was 41.6 points higher with desmopressin than with\ntranexamic acid (19.6 vs 63.6).107 Quality of life, as assessed\nthrough several instruments, was not explicitly compared between\nthe groups. Although both quality-of-life domain and instrument\nscores went up with both interventions, this was not statisti-\ncally significant. Comparative adverse effects were not estimable\nbetween tranexamic acid and desmopressin.\nThere was no difference between desmopressin and hormonal\ntherapy as assessed by alleviation of symptoms (RR, 0.90; 95% CI,\n0.66-1.23).74 Menstrual flow as assessed by PBAC was 0.9 points\nhigher in the desmopressin group than in the hormonal therapy\ngroup (95% CI, 9.89 lower to 11.69 higher). There were no adverse\nevents reported.\nNoncomparative data regarding a levonorgestrel-releasing intra-\nuterine system suggested control of heavy menstrual bleeding\nas assessed by PBAC score, improved health-related quality of\nlife, improvement in hemoglobin values, and shortened duration\nof menstruation.110,111 The expulsion rate for a levonorgestrel-\nreleasing intrauterine system was 15%, and the malposition rate\nwas 10%.\nOverall, the certainty of these estimated effects is very low because\nof risk of bias and indirect comparisons in the studies and\nimprecision of the estimates (evidence profile provided in\nsupplemental Data 5).\nOther EtD criteria and considerations.\nIn a survey of panel\nmembers before the meeting, responses varied as to whether\nwomen with heavy menstrual bleeding would find all treatment\noptions acceptable. Personal values and beliefs regarding hormonal\ntherapy may make these more or less acceptable to some women.\nAdverse effects of desmopressin would lower its acceptability.

Based on the evidence and their experience, the\npanel agreed that an intrauterine device (IUD) and CHC are\nsimilar. IUDs are less likely to result in systemic adverse effects\nthan CHC; however, IUDs require insertion, which might result in\ncomplications. When compared with those of tranexamic acid\nand desmopressin, the potential harms of an IUD and CHC were\njudged as intermediate. Even when it is properly positioned,\nexpulsion of a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system may\noccur more frequently in women with bleeding disorders, possibly\nbecause of increased menstrual bleeding during the first few periods\nafter insertion. The evidence, however, suggests that the rate of expulsion\nis low. A potential adverse effect of hormonal IUDs is an increase in the\nrisk of simple ovarian cysts, which are generally asymptomatic and\nself-limited, although some patients may require modification of\ntherapy. CHC also reduces the risk of ovarian hemorrhage by\nsuppressing ovulation. The panel discussed the fact that that even\nthough the studies included are the only evidence available that may\nbe relevant to inform this recommendation, they are indirect.\nThe recommendation for women who wish to conceive (Recom-\nmendation 6b) derives from the previous recommendation (Rec-\nommendation 6a), given that hormonal therapy is not an option for\nthese women.\nFor patients with frequent and severe bleeding events, we refer to the\nevidence and recommendations in “Prophylaxis” as to whether\nprophylaxis should be considered part of an individualized therapy plan.\nThe panel identified the following additional research needs: (1)\nstudies on the use of combined therapy vs single therapy (efficacy\nand safety of the combination of hormonal therapy with tranexamic\nacid), (2) studies assessing patients’ values and preferences\nregarding the benefits and harms of various contraceptive methods,\nand (3) a prospective study of a levonorgestrel-releasing in-\ntrauterine system in terms of acceptability rates, spotting rate, and\nrisk of expulsion or malposition.\nObstetrics: neuraxial anesthesia\nIn women with VWD who require or desire neuraxial anesthesia\nduring labor, should VWF concentrate be administered to achieve\na VWF activity level of 0.50 to 1.50 IU/mL or .1.50 IU/mL?\nRecommendation 7\nIn women with VWD for whom neuraxial anesthesia during la-\nbor is deemed suitable, the panel suggests targeting a VWF\nactivity level of 0.50 to 1.50 IU/mL over targeting an activity\nlevel of .1.50 IU/mL to allow neuraxial anesthesia (conditional\nrecommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of\neffects ⊕◯◯◯).\nRemarks:\nc\nNeuraxial anesthesia refers to spinal, epidural, or\ncombined spinal-epidural procedures performed for\nsurgical anesthesia for operative deliveries or pain\nrelief during labor.\nc\nThis recommendation focused on the outcomes of the\nanesthesia procedure itself and not on the effects of the\nVWF levels on PPH, in which VWF activity levels of\n.1.50 IU/mL may be advised in some situations.\nc\nIndividual risk assessment should be performed, taking\ninto account patient diagnosis and history, and for\nthis reason, the panel advocates a third-trimester visit\nwhere VWF and FVIII activity levels can be checked and\na prospective plan formed for anesthesia and delivery.\nc\nThis recommendation is intended for women who desire\nor require neuraxial anesthesia and does not address\nsuitability of neuraxial anesthesia itself.\nc\nVWF activity levels should be maintained at .0.50 IU/mL\nwhile the epidural is in place and for at least 6 hours after\nremoval.\nc\nThe assessment of whether neuraxial anesthesia is\nappropriate for an individual patient is a complex decision\nthat includes assessment of factors outside the scope of\nthese guidelines. The ultimate decision about whether\nit is appropriate for an individual patient to undergo\nthese procedures lies with the obstetric anesthesiol-\nogist or other clinician performing the procedure.\nDecisions regarding anesthesia and delivery should\nbe made in the context of a multidisciplinary discus-\nsion\nwith\ninput\nfrom\nanesthesia, hematology, and\nobstetrics and shared decision making with the patient.\nThese discussions should take place well in advance of the\npatient’s due date.\nc\nPatients should also be assessed for thrombotic risk\npostdelivery, and prophylaxis (eg, compression stock-\nings or low-molecular-weight heparin) should be pro-\nvided when needed.\nSummary of the evidence.\nWe did not find any comparative\nstudies addressing this question.

There were no spinal\nhematomas, maternal deaths, or adverse events in the child\nreported in either group. Although the survey of guideline\npanelists’ experience suggested better outcomes with a higher\ntarget VWF level, the panel did not feel it was substantial enough to\njustify recommending the higher target, given the lack of adequate\npublished evidence available to make judgments about how the\ndesirable effects and harms of the options compare (evidence\nprofile provided in supplemental Data 5).\nOther EtD criteria and considerations.\nThe panel judged\nthat there is possibly important uncertainty or variability in patient\nvalues and preferences, with some individuals placing a high\nvalue on avoiding bleeding and others a higher value on avoiding\nthrombotic complications. The panel also discussed the fact that\nvalues may vary in patients with more significant bleeding phenotypes\nand certain VWD subtypes, particularly types 2 and 3. Targeting\na higher level would increase costs of therapy and result in potential\ndelays if a specific VWF level were required before the procedure.\nConclusions and research needs for this recommendation.\nThe guideline panel determined that there is very low certainty in\nthe evidence for a net health benefit for targeting VWF levels of\n0.50 to 1.50 IU/mL in women with VWD for whom neuraxial\nanesthesia is deemed suitable during labor.

However, because of low\ncertainty in the evidence or no published information about other\noutcomes, the fact that we did not find evidence of an effect on\nthese outcomes does not imply that such an effect does not exist.\nGiven that there is no evidence to support a judgment on how the\noptions compare with regard to their effects on epidural health\noutcomes, the recommendation for targeting VWF levels of 0.50 to\n1.50 IU/mL over targeting a level of .1.50 IU/mL in women with\nVWD in labor who require or desire epidural treatment places a high\nvalue on increasing health equity and the lower cost of targeting\nlevels of 0.50 to 1.50 IU/mL. Recent research suggests that targeting\nhigher VWF levels may be beneficial in preventing PPH.118 Moreover,\nalthough higher factor levels may reduce PPH, some indirect data\nsuggest correlation between the presence of an epidural itself and\nhigher risk of PPH. Women who have neuraxial anesthesia are\nmore likely to have a longer second stage of labor, increased need\nfor oxytocin, and higher rate of instrumental deliveries. There\nmay be a larger potential risk of thrombosis when VWF levels are\n.1.50 IU/mL than when they are 0.50 to 1.50 IU/mL.\nThe panel identified the following additional research needs: (1)\nstudies evaluating whether patients with type 2 or 3 VWD\ncompletely correct defects in hemostasis and whether there are\ndifferences in this correction between plasma-derived and recombi-\nnant VWF replacement therapies; (2) studies to determine the role\nof platelet-derived VWF in hemostasis during pregnancy, particu-\nlarly in the settings of labor, delivery, and postpartum hemorrhage;\n(3) development and evaluation of clinical testing to ensure\nadequate primary hemostasis and determine whether therapy can\nbe guided by these tests to improve outcomes; and (4) studies to\ndirectly compare delivery and neurologic outcomes in women with\nVWD who are treated to achieve different target VWF and FVIII\nlevels, specifically evaluating the difference between a target\nlevel of $0.50 IU/mL and a target level of $1.50 IU/mL.\nObstetrics: postpartum management\nIn women with VWD, should tranexamic acid be prescribed (or not)\nduring the postpartum period?\nRecommendation 8\nThe guideline panel suggests the use of tranexamic acid over\nnot using it in women with type 1 VWD or low VWF levels (and\nthis may also apply to types 2 and 3 VWD) during the post-\npartum period) (conditional recommendation based on low\ncertainty in the evidence of effects ⊕⊕◯◯).\nGood practice statements:\nTranexamic acid may be given\nsystemically via the oral or IV route.

There is very low\ncertainty that there is an effect of tranexamic acid on other\noutcomes. However, because of low certainty in the evidence or no\npublished information about other outcomes, the fact that we did\nnot find evidence of an effect on these outcomes does not imply\nthat such an effect does not exist.\nThe recommendation for using tranexamic acid in women with VWD\nduring the postpartum period places a high value on the benefits of\nprevention and treatment during significant life-threatening hemor-\nrhages and the small harms of the intervention. The intervention is\nnot costly, and it is acceptable to key stakeholders and feasible to\nimplement.\nThe panel deliberated as to whether this recommendation should\nbe a strong recommendation, given the possibility of preventing life-\nthreatening bleeding in the setting of very minimal risk. However,\na majority could not agree on a strong recommendation because of\nthe lack of high-certainty evidence.\nAs noted in “Obstetrics: neuraxial anesthesia,” the ideal VWF\nactivity level to prevent postpartum hemorrhage is not known, but it\nis important to note that women who do not have VWD often\nachieve VWF activity levels of .1.50 IU/mL by the time of delivery,\nwhich raises the question of whether women with VWD are at\ngreater risk of postpartum hemorrhage if they do not achieve these\nsame physiologic levels.\nThe panel identified the following additional research needs: (1)\nresearch on the efficacy of tranexamic acid in the prevention and\ntreatment of PPH in women with VWD, including the optimal\nduration of therapy (and assessing the benefit of tranexamic acid in\nrelation to the prepartum bleeding phenotype); (2) a clinical trial on\nprevention of PPH; and (3) basic science research on understand-\ning fibrinolysis in women during the postpartum period.\nWhat are others saying, and what is new in\nthese guidelines?\nThe VWD guidelines discussed here are similar to previously\npublished guidelines, with an emphasis on the treatment of bleeding\nin VWD. Specific recommendations about the diagnosis of VWD,\nincluding diagnostic thresholds, are provided in the concurrently\npublished guidelines.18\nThe 2014 UK guidelines for diagnosis and management of VWD\nhave many similar recommendations to those stated here.122 These\ninclude use of prophylaxis for all patients with significant bleeding,\na desmopressin trial for patients with type 1 (or type 2A, 2B, or 2N)\nVWD, hormonal management for heavy menstrual bleeding, and use\nof neuraxial anesthesia with a VWF level of .0.50 IU/mL. In those\nguidelines, type 1 VWD was defined as a VWF level of ,0.30 IU/mL.\nDesmopressin with or without tranexamic acid was recommended\nfor minor surgery, such as dental work with an inferior dental block.\nFVIII levels of $0.50 IU/mL were recommended for the post-\noperative period and VWF activity levels of $0.50 IU/mL in the\nperioperative setting. The discussion in the UK guidelines highlights\nevidence for 6 days and for 7 to 10 days but does not ultimately\ncomment on the specific number of days required. This may vary by\ntype of surgery and requires attention to a specific patient’s surgical\nand bleeding history.\nThe 2008 US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guidelines\nalso recommended desmopressin trials, hormonal management\nfor heavy menses, and VWF levels of .0.50 IU/mL for neuraxial\nanesthesia.123 Antifibrinolytics combined with desmopressin were\nrecommended for oral surgery. After major surgery, it was recommended\nto keep both FVIII and VWF activity levels .0.50 IU/mL for 7 to 10 days.\nOur guidelines do differ from the UK and National Heart, Lung, and\nBlood Institute guidelines somewhat in that the strength of the\nevidence is discussed, and for many recommendations, choices are\noffered to include patient and family preferences when a clearly\noptimal treatment choice is lacking. This empowers patients and their\nproviders to make decisions based on individual bleeding history,\npreferences, and values with the best information available at present.\nThese guidelines focus on the most common inherited forms of\nVWD; however, we would like to highlight the recently published\nguidelines on the diagnosis and management of platelet-type VWD\nfrom the ISTH Platelet Physiology Subcommittee124 and several\nrecent reviews on acquired von Willebrand syndrome.125,126\nLimitations of these guidelines\nThe limitations of these guidelines are inherent in the low or very low\ncertainty in the evidence we identified for many of the questions.\nRevision or adaptation of the guidelines\nPlans for updating these guidelines\nAfter publication of these guidelines, the collaborating organ-\nizations will maintain them through surveillance for new ev-\nidence, ongoing review by experts, and regular revisions based\non literature searches.\nUpdating or adapting recommendations locally\nAdaptation of these guidelines will be necessary in many circum-\nstances.

Accurate and timely diagnosis presents numerous challenges.\nObjective: These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH),\nthe International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), the National Hemophilia\nFoundation (NHF), and the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) are intended to support patients,\nclinicians, and other health care professionals in their decisions about VWD diagnosis.\nMethods: ASH, ISTH, NHF, and WFH established a multidisciplinary guideline panel that\nincluded 4 patient representatives and was balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of\ninterest. The Outcomes and Implementation Research Unit at the University of Kansas Medical\nCenter (KUMC) supported the guideline-development process, including performing or updating\nsystematic evidence reviews up to 8 January 2020. The panel prioritized clinical questions and\noutcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The panel used the Grading\nof Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, including\nGRADE Evidence-to-Decision frameworks, to assess evidence and make recommendations, which\nwere subsequently subject to public comment.\nResults: The panel agreed on 11 recommendations.\nConclusions: Key recommendations of these guidelines include the role of bleeding-assessment tools\nin the assessment of patients suspected of VWD, diagnostic assays and laboratory cutoffs for type 1\nand type 2 VWD, how to approach a type 1 VWD patient with normalized levels over time, and the role of\ngenetic testing vs phenotypic assays for types 2B and 2N. Future critical research priorities are also\nidentified.\nSummary of recommendations\nThese guidelines are based on updated and original systematic reviews of evidence conducted\nunder the direction of the Outcomes and Implementation Research Unit at the University\nof Kansas Medical Center (KUMC). The panel followed best practices for guideline develop-\nment recommended by the Institute of Medicine and the Guidelines International Network\n(G-I-N).1-3 The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development\nand Evaluation (GRADE) approach4-10 to assess the certainty in the evidence and formulate\nrecommendations.\nSubmitted 3 September 2020; accepted 23 October 2020; published online 12\nJanuary 2021.

The current classification includes types 1 and 3, which\nare characterized by quantitative deficiencies of von Willebrand\nfactor (VWF), as well as types 2A, 2B, 2M, and 2N, which are\nqualitative variants. Clinically, VWD patients experience exces-\nsive mucocutaneous bleeding, including heavy menstrual bleed-\ning, epistaxis, easy bruising, prolonged bleeding from minor\nwounds and the oral cavity, and gastrointestinal bleeding, as well\nas bleeding after dental work, childbirth, and surgery, with\nmusculoskeletal bleeding also seen in the most severe cases.\nTreatment includes adjunctive therapies, such as tranexamic\nacid, and therapies that directly increase the levels of VWF, such\nas desmopressin and VWF concentrates. The accurate and\ntimely diagnosis of VWD remains a challenge for clinicians and\npatients.\nPlease see Figure 1 for an overall algorithm addressing the\ndiagnosis of VWD.\nInterpretation of strong and\nconditional recommendations\nThe strength of a recommendation is expressed as either strong\n(“the guideline panel recommends...”), or conditional (“the guideline\npanel suggests…”) and has the following interpretation:\nPatients suspected of VWD \nPositive/\nAbnormal  BS\nNegative/\nNormal BS\nVWF Levels \u001f30\nCBC, PT/PTT  (optional - fibrinogen, TT)\nVWF:Ag, platelet-dependent VWF\nactivity, FVIII:C\nr/o VWD\nReconsider Diagnosis\nPlatelet-dependent VWF\nactivity/VWF:Ag ratio\n!0.7\n\u001f0.7\ntype 1 VWD\nDDAVP trial\ntype 1 C VWD\ntype 2 VWD\nVWF:CB/Ag\nor multimer\ntype\n2A,B\nVWD\ntype 2M\nVWD\nGenetic\nTesting \nConfirm type 2B VWD \n1\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n10\n9\nBleeding Assessment Tool\nr/o VWD\nNormalized VWF\nlevels with age\nVWF Levels 30-50\nNo bleeding\nBleeding\nFVIII \u001f VWF\nVWF:FVIIIB\nor genetic\ntesting\nConfirm type 2N VWD \nAbnormal\nNormal\n2*\nVWF Levels ! 50\n+\nFigure 1.

Many included studies suffered from a high\nrisk of bias due to the lack of clear reference standards and\nissues with patient selection.\nIntroduction\nAims of these guidelines and specific objectives\nThe purpose of these guidelines is to provide evidence-based\nrecommendations on the diagnosis of VWD. The primary\ngoals of these guidelines are to review, critically appraise, and\nimplement evidence-based recommendations that will im-\nprove the accurate identification of affected patients while\nminimizing inappropriate testing and the harms of overdiag-\nnosis. Through improved provider and patient education using\nthe available evidence and evidence-based recommenda-\ntions, these guidelines aim to provide clinical decision sup-\nport for shared decision-making that will result in accurate\nVWD diagnoses, which will lead to improved education and\ncounseling of patients as well as effective treatment and\nprevention of bleeding episodes. The target audience includes\nhematologists, general practitioners, internists, other clinicians and\ndecision-makers, and patients.

This document may also\nserve as the basis for adaptation by local, regional, or national\nguideline panels.\nDescription of the health problem\nIn 1926, a Finnish physician, Erik von Willebrand, published a\ndescription of a new bleeding disorder that he observed in a family\nliving in the ˚Aland Islands in the Baltic Sea.12 The index case was a\nyoung woman who bled to death at the time of her fourth menstrual\nperiod; many other family members also suffered from excessive\nbleeding. In the original report, the disease was referred to as\n“pseudohemophilia”; however, it later came to be known as VWD.\nVWD is caused by deficiency or dysfunction of the multimeric\nglycoprotein VWF, which plays key hemostatic roles in the\ncirculation, including platelet adhesion and aggregation at sites of\nvascular injury, and acts as a chaperone for FVIII.13 The VWF gene\nis located on the long arm of chromosome 12 and comprises 52\nexons that encode 2813 amino acids.14\nVWD is characterized by excessive mucocutaneous bleeding, such\nas heavy menstrual bleeding, epistaxis, easy bruising, prolonged\nbleeding from minor wounds and the oral cavity, and gastrointestinal\nPatients suspected of type 2N VWD\nVWF Factor VIII binding (VWF:FVIII)\ngenetic testing \nAbnormal\nDiagnose type 2N\nVWD\nNormal\nFVIII level\nConsider other\nVWD subtypes or\nHemophilia A\nPositive for\ntype 2N VWD\nvariant(s)\nPositive for\nnovel genetic\nvariant\nDiagnose\ntype 2N\nVWD\nVWF:FVIII\nNegative\nRule\nout\ntype  2N\nVWD\nConsider other\nVWD subtypes or\nHemophilia A\nPositive\nNegative\nAbnormal\nNormal\nGenetic\ntesting F8\nGenetic\ntesting for \ntype 2N VWD \nvariant(s) \nPositive\nNegative\nFigure 3.

VWD\nprevalence estimates range from ;1 in 100 to 1 in 10 000.13,15-17\nAt the level of primary care, ;1 in 1000 individuals are affected and\nrequire medical attention for bleeding.18,19 The current Interna-\ntional Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) classifica-\ntion recognizes 3 types: type 1 is a partial quantitative deficiency\nof VWF, type 2 is caused by qualitative abnormalities of VWF, and\ntype 3 is a virtual absence of the VWF protein with associated very\nlow FVIII levels. Type 2 VWD is further divided into 4 subtypes:\ntype 2A is characterized by reduced or absent high-molecular-\nweight VWF, type 2B results from a gain of function in VWF that\nincreases its affinity for platelets, type 2M is caused by reduced\nVWF interactions with platelets or collagen, and type 2N results\nfrom reduced binding of VWF to FVIII.20 The panel approached\nthis guideline within the framework of this classification system\nwith the addition of type 1C VWD, which is caused by increased\nVWF clearance, given that it has management implications for\npatients.21,22\nA major challenge for affected patients is achieving an accurate and\ntimely diagnosis.23-26 Patients experience delays of 15 years or\nmore from the onset of bleeding symptoms to a VWD diagnosis,\nand confusion remains about the distinction and importance of the\ntypes and subtypes described above.27 Barriers to an accurate\ndiagnosis include a lack of understanding of the difference between\nnormal and abnormal bleeding symptoms, lack of clarity around an\nappropriate diagnostic approach, and limited availability and\nexpertise of specialized laboratory testing. These considerations\ninformed the panel’s deliberations, with a high value being placed\non not missing affected patients. Overall, priorities for this guideline\nwere informed by an international survey of stakeholders, including\nhealth care providers, patients, and caregivers, facilitated by the\npartner organizations.28\nMethods\nThe guideline panel developed and graded the recommendations\nand assessed the certainty in the supporting evidence following the\nGRADE approach.4-9,29,30 The overall guideline-development pro-\ncess, including funding of the work, panel formation, management\nof conflicts of interest, internal and external review, and organiza-\ntional approval, was guided by American Society of Hematology\n(ASH) policies and procedures derived from the G-I-N–McMaster\nGuideline Development Checklist (http://cebgrade.mcmaster.ca/\nguidecheck.html)31 and was intended to meet recommendations\nfor trustworthy guidelines by the Institute of Medicine (IOM)\nand G-I-N.1-3\nOrganization, panel composition, planning,\nand coordination\nThese guidelines were developed as a collaboration by ASH, the\nInternational Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), the\nNational Hemophilia Foundation (NHF), and the World Federation\nof Hemophilia (WFH).

Individuals disclosed direct financial\ninterests for 2 years prior to appointment in part A of the forms,\nindirect financial interests in part B, and relevant other interests (not\nmainly financial) in part C. Part D describes new interests disclosed\nby individuals after appointment. Part E summarizes ASH decisions\nabout which interests were judged to be conflicts and how they\nwere managed, including through recusal.\nSupplemental File 3 provides the complete disclosure-of-interest\nforms of researchers who contributed to these guidelines.\nFormulating specific clinical questions and\ndetermining outcomes of interest\nThe\npanel\nused\nthe\nGRADEpro\nguideline-development\ntool\n(www.gradepro.org)35 and SurveyMonkey (www.surveymonkey.-\ncom) to brainstorm and then prioritize the questions described in\nTable 1. To generate the initial list of possible questions, a working\ngroup of clinicians, patients, and representatives from ASH, ISTH,\nNHF, and WFH was established prior to the formation of the\nguideline panel. A survey was developed by the KUMC methods\nteam to prioritize these questions, and it was then translated from\nEnglish into French and Spanish and widely publicized. Six hundred\none participants responded from 71 countries, including clinicians,\npatients and caregivers, and members of allied health teams.\nDetailed information about this process, which determined the 10\nquestions to be included in the guideline, was published in 2019.28\nThe panel selected outcomes of interest for each question a priori,\nfollowing the approach described in detail elsewhere.6 Although\nacknowledging considerable variation in the impact on patient\noutcomes, the panel considered the following outcomes as critical\nfor clinical decision-making across questions: major bleeding,\ntransfusion and treatment, gastrointestinal bleeding, blood loss,\nsymptom severity, minor bleeding, mortality, and unnecessary\ntesting. These outcomes will be affected by the accurate diagnosis\nof different subtypes of VWD and avoiding inaccurate mislabeling of\npatients.\nTable 1.

The EtD table addressed effects\nof interventions, resource utilization (cost-effectiveness), values\nand preferences (relative importance of outcomes), equity, accept-\nability, and feasibility. The guideline panel reviewed draft EtD\ntables before, during, or after the guideline panel meeting, made\nsuggestions for corrections, and identified missing evidence. To\nensure that recent studies were not missed, searches (presented\nin supplemental File 4) were updated on 8 January 2020, and panel\nmembers were asked to suggest any studies that might have\nbeen considered missed that fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the\nindividual questions.\nUnder the direction of the Outcomes and Implementation Research\nUnit at KUMC, researchers followed the general methods outlined\nin the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions\n(handbook.cochrane.org) for conducting updated or new system-\natic reviews of intervention effects. For new reviews, risk of bias\nwas assessed at the health outcome level using the Cochrane\nCollaboration’s risk-of-bias tool for nonrandomized studies\nand the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2\n(QUADAS-2) tool for test-accuracy studies.36 In addition to\nconducting systematic reviews of test accuracy, the researchers\nsearched for evidence related to baseline risks, values, prefer-\nences, and costs, and summarized findings within the EtD\nframeworks.4,5,30 Subsequently, the certainty in the body of\nevidence (also known as quality of the evidence or confidence\nin the estimated effects) was assessed for test-accuracy out-\ncomes following the GRADE approach based on the following\ndomains: risk of bias; precision, consistency, and magnitude of\nthe estimates of effects; directness of the evidence; and risk\nof publication bias. The certainty was categorized into 4 levels:\nvery low (Å◯◯◯), low (ÅÅ◯◯), moderate (ÅÅÅ◯), and high\n(ÅÅÅÅ).7,8,29,30,37-39\nDuring a 2-day in-person meeting followed by online communication\nand conference calls, the panel developed clinical recommenda-\ntions based on the evidence summarized in the EtD tables. For each\nrecommendation, the panel took a population perspective and\ncame to consensus on the following: the certainty in the evidence,\nthe balance of benefits and harms of the compared management\noptions, and the assumptions about the values and preferences\nassociated with the decision. The guideline panel also explicitly took\ninto account the extent of resource use associated with alternative\nmanagement options. The panel agreed on the recommendations\n(including direction and strength), remarks, and qualifications by\nconsensus based on the balance of all desirable and undesirable\nconsequences. The final guidelines, including recommendations,\nwere reviewed and approved by all members of the panel.\nInterpretation of strong and\nconditional recommendations\nThe recommendations are labeled as either “strong” or “conditional”\naccording to the GRADE approach. The words “the guideline panel\nrecommends” are used for strong recommendations, and “the\nguideline panel suggests” for conditional recommendations. Table 2\nprovides GRADE’s interpretation of strong and conditional recom-\nmendations by patients, clinicians, health care policy makers, and\nresearchers.\nDocument review\nDraft recommendations were reviewed by all members of the\npanel, revised, and then made available online on 6 April 2020\nfor external review by stakeholders including allied organiza-\ntions, other medical professionals, patients, and the public;\n51 individuals submitted comments. The document was revised\nto address pertinent comments, but no changes were made to\nrecommendations.

Interpretation of strong and conditional recommendations\nImplications for\nStrong recommendation\nConditional recommendation\nPatients\nMost individuals in this situation would want the recommended\ncourse of action, and only a small proportion would not.\nThe majority of individuals in this situation would want the\nsuggested course of action, but many would not. Decision aids\nmay be useful in helping patients to make decisions consistent\nwith their individual risks, values, and preferences.\nClinicians\nMost individuals should follow the recommended course of action.\nFormal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual\npatients make decisions consistent with their values and\npreferences.\nRecognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual\npatients and that you must help each patient arrive at a\nmanagement decision consistent with their values and\npreferences. Decision aids may be useful in helping individuals to\nmake decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and\npreferences.\nPolicy makers\nThe recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations.\nAdherence to this recommendation according to the guideline\ncould be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator.\nPolicy making will require substantial debate and involvement of\nvarious stakeholders. Performance measures about the\nsuggested course of action should focus on whether an\nappropriate decision-making process is fully documented.\nResearchers\nThe recommendation is supported by credible research or other\nconvincing judgments that make additional research unlikely to\nalter the recommendation. On occasion, a strong\nrecommendation is based on low or very low certainty in the\nevidence. In such instances, further research may provide\nimportant information that alters the recommendations.\nThe recommendation is likely to be strengthened (for future\nupdates or adaptation) by additional research. An evaluation of\nthe conditions and criteria (and the related judgments, research\nevidence, and additional considerations) that determined the\nconditional (rather than strong) recommendation will help\nidentify possible research gaps.\n288\nJAMES et al\n12 JANUARY 2021 x VOLUME 5, NUMBER 1\nDownloaded from http://ashpublications.org/bloodadvances/article-pdf/5/1/280/1808130/advancesadv2020003265c.pdf by guest on 04 June 2025", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/vWD/advancesadv2020003265c.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604170034", "file_path": "knowledge_base/vWD/advancesadv2020003265c.pdf", "total_pages": 21, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604170034", "page": 8}}
{"doc_id": "62edb8cd-1e21-4b1b-98a3-e8875220e9a4", "content": "Summary of the evidence.\nThese recommendations were\nstratified on 3 VWD prevalences to account for the frequency\nof affected patients in different populations or clinical settings.\nRecommendation 1 is intended for primary care practitioners assuming\na relatively low VWD prevalence in their clinic population, based on\nliterature that shows an ;3% prevalence of bleeding disorders in a\npopulation with abnormal laboratory tests (eg, prolonged aPTT).40\nRecommendation 2 assumes a 20% VWD prevalence and is based\non studies of consecutive patients referred to a hematology clinic,\ntypically because of a personal history of bleeding/bruising and/or\nbecause of abnormal initial laboratory tests (eg, prolonged aPTT).41\nRecommendation 3 assumes a 50% prevalence and is based on\nindividuals with an affected first-degree relative, in keeping with the\nautosomal-dominant inheritance of most subtypes of the disease,\nregardless of bleeding symptoms or the results of initial laboratory\ntests.42,43 For these recommendations, 7 cohort studies that included\n112 patients with a pooled sensitivity of 0.75 (95% confidence interval\n[CI], 0.66-0.83) were assessed and judged to be highly accurate; the\nsensitivity data were strongest for adult women. For specificity, the 7\ncohort studies included 863 patients and had a pooled specificity of\n0.54 (95% CI, 0.29-0.77) with moderate test accuracy.44-50 It is\nimportant to note that the included studies assessed the use of\nvalidated BATs vs not using a BAT rather than nonstandardized\ntesting. A detailed review of validated BATs can be found at\nhttps://elearning.wfh.org/resource/compendium-of-assessment-tools/\n#bleeding_assessment_tools1a42-60ce78a1-2573f205-9a34. The\nEtD frameworks for these recommendations are available online at\nhttps://guidelines.ash.gradepro.org/profile/RBzFDJwKapc and https://\nguidelines.ash.gradepro.org/profile/aVdJ7pZVxu4.\nBenefits, harms, and burden.\nThe primary benefit of a BAT is\nto identify patients who have VWD but would be missed without the\nuse of this tool. Additionally, BATs provide a standardized approach\nto assessment. The panel considered not missing an affected\npatient an important benefit, in addition to identifying patients in\na timely manner and decreasing unnecessary blood testing.\nFurthermore, BATs provide educational value to patients and\nclinical experts about bleeding symptoms and possible interven-\ntions, and offer validation to patients by recognizing symptoms\nof the disease. It is important to acknowledge that the identified\nstudies using BATs as a screening tool included mostly women:\nthey are most effective in this patient group.\nThe potential harms that could be caused by the use of a BAT\ninclude the possibility of missing affected individuals who have\nnot manifested bleeding symptoms, such as men and children.\nThis key issue is why, in higher-prevalence settings, BATs should be\nused in conjunction with specific blood testing rather than as the\nsole screening tool to decide whether blood testing should be done.\nBATs may also identify individuals who have bleeding disorders other\nthan VWD; however, appropriate laboratory testing should distinguish\nthose individuals. Additionally, some treatments will also be helpful for\nindividuals with other bleeding disorders (such as tranexamic acid or\ncombined oral contraceptives for heavy menstrual bleeding).\nOther EtD criteria and considerations.\nPublished BATs are\nall freely available, but the administration of an expert-administered\nversion takes time in the clinic (including the requirement of appropriate\ntraining and education for the individual administering the tool). The\nself-administered BAT (Self-BAT) addresses this issue; however, it\nis currently available only in English and French.46 The ISTH-BAT\n(which is expert-administered) has been translated and is available\nin German, Italian, Norwegian, Spanish,51 and Japanese (http://\nsquare.umin.ac.jp/kintenka/index.html). BATs are generally accepted\nby patients, as there is widespread familiarity with the completion of\nhealth-related questionnaires across many clinical settings. BATs\n(particularly expert-administered versions) may be less feasi-\nble in the primary care setting because of time and resource\nconstraints.\nConclusions and research needs for these recommendations.\nThe panel determined that there is a moderate certainty of evidence\nfor the test accuracy of the validated BATs. The panel agreed that\nthere is a net benefit from the use of BATs in a low-prevalence\nsetting but that in higher-prevalence settings, BATs should not be\nused as a sole screening test to determine who needs additional\ntesting. Based on the available evidence, it is likely that the use of\nBATs will identify patients with VWD in primary care settings to\nhelp clinicians identify who needs additional, specialized labora-\ntory testing. In other clinical settings, the use of BATs provides\na standardized method for the documentation and assessment\nof the severity of bleeding symptoms as an adjunct to labora-\ntory testing. With these recommendations, the panel considered\npublished data from the use of a number of different BATs;\nhowever, many have evolved from the Vicenza bleeding question-\nnaire published in 2005 and have a high degree of overlap in their\nquestions and the scoring systems.52 Additionally, the ISTH recently\npublished a consensus BAT endorsed by that organization.53 The\npanel identified the need for future studies focused on the sensi-", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/vWD/advancesadv2020003265c.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604170034", "file_path": "knowledge_base/vWD/advancesadv2020003265c.pdf", "total_pages": 21, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604170034", "page": 9}}

Additionally, although the published studies were\ncomparable in terms of test accuracy, they did not include a large\nnumber of patients of African descent and therefore do not clearly\nreflect the presence of VWF variants in that population that can affect\nristocetin binding with the VWF:RCo but do not affect VWF function\nor represent the true risk of bleeding (eg, the D1472H sequence\nvariant).60,61 This creates the risk of overdiagnosis of these patients\nwith VWF:RCo, which was considered a potential harm.\nOther EtD criteria and considerations.\nAlthough estimates vary\nbetween countries, in general, the price is comparable between\nassays but payer systems and levels of insurability vary widely. The\nspecialized technical nature of these assays (and the required expertise\nto perform and interpret them) is another limitation to widespread\navailability, as are issues of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\napproval of the newer assays in the United States. Lastly, not all tests\nare available in all laboratories, and decisions to switch from one assay\nto another must take into account local circumstances.\nConclusions and research needs for this recommendation.\nThe guideline panel determined that there is low-certainty evidence\nfor a net health benefit from using newer assays that measure the\nplatelet-binding activity of VWF (eg, VWF:GPIbM, VWF:GPIbR)\nover VWF:RCo for patients suspected of having VWD. Other EtD\ncriteria were generally in favor of using the newer assays. The panel\nidentified the need for additional research focused on the performance\nof the assays in different racial/ethnic groups. Additionally, the panel\nidentified the need for international guidance on detailed characteris-\ntics of appropriate laboratory expertise for VWF assays.\nVWF levels that normalize with age\nFor patients with a historic diagnosis of type 1 VWD but who now have\nnormal VWF levels, should the diagnosis of VWD be reconsidered,\nor should it be removed?\nRecommendation 5\nThe panel suggests reconsidering the diagnosis as opposed to\nremoving the diagnosis for patients with previously confirmed\ntype 1 VWD who now have VWF levels that have normalized\nwith age (conditional recommendation based on very low\ncertainty in the evidence of effects Å◯◯◯).\nRemarks:\nc\nWith this recommendation, the panel worked under the\nassumption that the original diagnosis of type 1 VWD\nwas accurate.\nc\nAging and comorbidities are known to increase VWF\nlevels.

The widespread lack of age-specific normal ranges was also\nidentified as a complicating factor. The possibility that changes in the\nability of laboratories to measure VWF:RCo could be playing a role\nwas considered; however, in 1987, Gill et al published a cross-\nsectional study of blood donors that showed a 0.01 IU/mL annual\nincrease in VWF levels between 20 and 60 years of age, suggesting\nthat the levels truly do increase with age.68 Whether that is in relation\nto comorbidities or independent of them remains unclear.

The response\nto desmopressin can also identify these patients, if a 4-hour\npostinfusion time point is included and shows a .30% decrease\nfrom the peak VWF level.79 Five studies were reviewed to address\nthis question, including 2 that evaluated the correlation between\nthe VWFpp/VWF:Ag ratio and VWF half-life78,79 and 3 that\nreported on the correlation of the VWFpp/VWF:Ag ratio and VWF\nmutation.21,22,80 No test-accuracy results were presented in the\nincluded studies because of the lack of an accepted reference\nstandard to define type 1C VWD. In general, a higher VWFpp/\nVWF:Ag ratio was associated with a shorter VWF half-life and a\nhigher rate of an identified VWF mutation, but it was noted that in some\npatients, the ratio can be normal but the clearance of VWF rapid.79\nThe EtD framework for this recommendation is available online at\nhttps://guidelines.ash.gradepro.org/profile/wBmLq8BFekg.\nBenefits, harms, and burden.\nThe accurate identification of\npatients who have type 1C VWD has management implications,\nas these patients may require VWF concentrate to treat/prevent\nbleeds. A desmopressin trial, in addition to identifying patients with\nincreased VWF clearance, also provides very useful information to\nthe clinician about the utility of that treatment of an individual patient.\nNot all patients can safely undergo a desmopressin trial, including\nvery young and very old patients, because of the risks associated\nwith desmopressin (eg, hyponatremia or thrombosis); in these\npatients, the VWFpp/VWF:Ag ratio could be helpful.\nOther EtD criteria and considerations.\nDesmopressin trials\nrequire significant resources to complete in terms of nursing time,\nclinic space, and laboratory costs. Repeated blood draws are\nrequired, which could decrease acceptability for some patients. A\nsignificant time commitment is also required to complete the trial,\nincluding 1- and 4-hour postinfusion levels, resulting in patients\nneeding to make an extra visit to clinic and miss a day of work or\nschool; however, with a clear explanation of why the trial (and the\n4-hour postinfusion level) is needed, it is likely that most patients\nwould agree to have it performed. Lastly, protocols for the\ncompletion of desmopressin trials and definitions of responsive-\nness vary widely. Conversely, the VWFpp assay is simple to\nperform and requires only a single blood draw, but it is not\navailable in most clinical laboratories.\nConclusions and research needs for this recommendation.\nOverall, the panel determined that there is low certainty for a net\nhealth benefit from the use of a desmopressin trial over the VWFpp/\nVWF:Ag ratio for the identification of type 1C VWD. Feasibility and\nacceptability concerns for desmopressin trials were judged to be\nsubstantial, but this did not outweigh the lack of availability of the\nVWFpp assay.

Patients with type 2 VWD generally have more\nsignificant bleeding than those with type 1 VWD, and the family\nhistories are clearly autosomal dominant, without the issues of\nincomplete penetrance or variable expressivity that complicate\nmilder forms of type 1 VWD.45 Desmopressin is relatively\ncontraindicated in type 2B VWD, as it may cause thrombocy-\ntopenia due to increased platelet binding; however, patients\nsuspected of having this subtype would usually have additional\ntesting performed, such as genetic testing, that would clarify the\nsubtype.94 Patients with type 2A or 2M are less likely to respond\nto desmopressin, but this would be identified at the time of a\ndesmopressin trial.95 Other treatment decisions are not likely to\nvary significantly between subtypes.\nOther EtD criteria and considerations.\nThe VWF:CB assay\nis not widely available, and there are differences in the type of\ncollagen used.

There was serious risk of bias because of\nthe case-control study design and serious issues with the reference\nstandard and/or index test bias in many of the studies; type 2B\nVWD is often defined by the VWF mutation and/or the identification\nof platelet agglutination with a low ristocetin concentration on RIPA.\nThe EtD framework for this recommendation is available online at\nhttps://guidelines.ash.gradepro.org/profile/hGn1YO1dxh4.\nBenefits, harms, and burden.\nThe accurate identification of\ntype 2B VWD is important because it has relevance for prognosis\nand also treatment.

Genetic testing is not available at all centers, but it is\nrelatively straightforward to ship samples for this type of analysis.\nLikewise, RIPA is not available at all centers; however, that test\nrequires a fresh sample; therefore, shipping is not possible, limiting\naccessibility to the test. Additionally, the methodology to perform a\nRIPA is not standardized, and different concentrations of ristocetin\nhave been proposed as indicating a positive test (eg, 0.5 mg/mL\nand 0.25 mg/mL). In general, patients accept having either test\nperformed; however, there are some patient groups that have\nconcerns about genetic tests (eg, some First Nations people).\nGenetic testing is typically more expensive than RIPA, and\ninsurance coverage is variable.\nConclusions and research needs.\nThe panel determined\nthat there is low-certainty evidence for a net health benefit\nfrom the use of targeted genetic testing (when available)\nover RIPA to diagnose type 2B VWD. Additional research,\nfocused on the diagnostic test accuracy of RIPA, would be\nbeneficial.\nFor patients suspected of type 2N VWD in need of additional\ntesting, should VWF:FVIIIB or targeted genetic testing be used to\ndiagnose type 2N VWD?\nRecommendation 11\nThe panel suggests using either VWF:FVIIIB or targeted ge-\nnetic testing (when available) for patients with suspected type\n2N VWD in need of additional testing (Figure 3) (conditional\nrecommendation based on low certainty in the evidence from\ndiagnostic accuracy studies ÅÅ◯◯).\nSummary of the evidence.\nWe identified 17 studies that\naddressed this question, 16 that reported on the identification of\na type 2N mutation57,103,105,107-119 and 13 that reported the\ncorrelation between assays.57,102,103,105,107,109-111,114-117,119 The\nsensitivities of both genetic testing and the VWF:FVIIIB assay were\nreported as 1.00 (95% CI, 1.00-1.00); however, both were used as\nthe reference standard, resulting in serious bias. Specificity was not\navailable from the included studies. There was also serious patient-\nselection bias due to the case-control study design in all studies.\nThe EtD framework for this recommendation is available online at\nhttps://guidelines.ash.gradepro.org/profile/HDVamZn5f-0.\nBenefits, harms, and burden.\nThe accurate identification of\ntype 2N VWD is important for a number of reasons. In contrast to\nall other type 2 and type 1 VWD, type 2N is autosomal recessive,\nwhich is critical for appropriate genetic counseling within families.\nType 2N VWD can be mistaken for hemophilia A because of the\nlow FVIII level, with critical treatment implications: patients with\nhemophilia A are treated with FVIII concentrate; however, type 2N\nVWD patients require VWF replacement therapy to prevent/treat\nserious bleeds. Pathogenic VWF variants that cause type 2N VWD\nare generally found in exons 18 to 20; however, novel variants that\nhave not been previously described or characterized can be found.120\nIn those cases, evidence of the phenotype is required (decreased\nbinding of FVIII by VWF, which would be identified by the VWF:FVIIIB\nassay). However, doing only the VWF:FVIIIB assay will not be as\ninformative as genetic testing for family counseling, as patients with\ntype 2N VWD can be homozygous for a single 2N variant or compound\nheterozygous for 2 2N variants (and in both cases a child would\nbe heterozygous for a 2N allele and unlikely to manifest bleeding);\nsometimes only a single 2N variant is found, in which case it is assumed\nthat there is coinheritance of a null allele (therefore, a child could be\nheterozygous for 2N with no bleeding or could have type 1 VWD).\nAdditionally, if an F8 variant is identified as opposed to a VWF variant,\nthen the diagnosis can be confirmed as hemophilia A with appropriate\ntreatment and genetic counseling for X-linked inheritance.120\nOther EtD criteria and considerations.\nGenetic testing is not\navailable at all centers, but it is relatively straightforward to ship\nsamples to reference laboratories for this type of analysis. Likewise,\nVWF:FVIIIB is not available at all centers, but shipping of plasma is\npossible. In general, patients accept having either test performed;\nhowever, there are some patient groups that have concerns\nabout genetic testing (eg, some First Nations people).

Indeed, the panel agreed that the\ntests can be complementary in the diagnostic workup of patients.\nIdentifying a reference standard for type 2N VWD was identified as\na research priority.\nWhat are others saying and what is new in\nthese guidelines?\nMultiple published guidelines recommend a cutoff of ,0.30 IU/mL\nfor a definite diagnosis of type 1 VWD, with the US National\nInstitutes of Health National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\n(NHLBI) guidelines stating that “this recommendation does not\npreclude the diagnosis of VWD in individuals with VWF:RCo of\n30 to 50 IU/dL if there is supporting clinical evidence and/or family\nevidence for VWD.”75 The recommendation of the United Kingdom\nHaemophilia Centre Doctors Organization (UKHCDO) states: “Patients\nwith an appropriate bleeding history and VWF activity 0.30-0.50 IU/mL\nshould be regarded as having primary hemostatic bleeding with\nreduced VWF as a risk factor rather than VWD. We suggest\nreferring to this as ‘Low VWF’.”55 This guideline panel prioritized\nensuring access to medical care and therefore recommends a\nlevel of ,0.30 IU/mL regardless of bleeding and a VWF level of\n0.30 to 0.50 IU/mL for patients with abnormal bleeding to confirm\nthe diagnosis of type 1 VWD. There was significant concern that\nthe term “Low VWF” creates an unintentional barrier to patients\nreceiving appropriate care because of a lack of a clear diagnosis,\nparticularly in countries without universal health care systems. A\npatient’s bleeding symptoms were the primary consideration for\nthis recommendation.\nRecently, the NHF Medical and Scientific Advisory Council (MASAC)\nraised concern about the critical importance of preanalytical variables\nin VWD testing, and the possibility of false-positive results from\nsamples processed or shipped improperly.121 This guideline panel\nacknowledges the significance of this issue in avoiding a misdiagnosis\n294\nJAMES et al\n12 JANUARY 2021 x VOLUME 5, NUMBER 1\nDownloaded from http://ashpublications.org/bloodadvances/article-pdf/5/1/280/1808130/advancesadv2020003265c.pdf by guest on 04 June 2025", "metadata": {"source": "knowledge_base/vWD/advancesadv2020003265c.pdf", "chunk_index": 1, "lang": "en", "producer": "PDFium", "creator": "PDFium", "creationdate": "D:20250604170034", "file_path": "knowledge_base/vWD/advancesadv2020003265c.pdf", "total_pages": 21, "format": "PDF 1.7", "title": "", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "", "trapped": "", "modDate": "", "creationDate": "D:20250604170034", "page": 14}}
